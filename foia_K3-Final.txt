D0|Immigration   --  Skills of Immigrants: The attached U.S. News article discusses the issue of whether we should change our legal immigration system to strengthen  preferences for skilled and well-educated prospective  immigrants  over those that are poorly educated  and unskilled.|||0.954294682|0.001196358
D0|The current immigration system is set up to favor keeping families intact.|||0.93726635|0.005658878
D0|Thus, the vast number of legal immigrants are brought to this country through family-based visas, which do  not take into account education or skill level.|||-0.998993456|0.23502232
D0|The article cites a Rand  study proposal  to create a point system of immigration which continues to  give  weight  to  immediate  family  reunification but  would  also give points  for education, language  skills, and work experience.|||-0.950692594|0.76556295
D0|The final report of the Commission on Immigration Reform also recommends a shift  in priority toward  higher skilled immigrants.|||-0.737256944|0.001339523
D0|Instead creating a point system, the Commission recommends revising skill-based admissions (approximately 100,000 visas) to favor highly-skilled and educated immigrants and eliminating altogether the category of unskilled workers.|||-0.982948482|0.003349694
D0|Though we think that these ideas are well worth exploring, it is unlikely that Congress will want to consider an overhaul of legal immigration this year.|||-0.966573834|0.9937038
D0|Efforts to reduce legal immigration levels were defeated during consideration of the 1996 illegal immigration law.|||-0.934064806|1.22E-05

D1|Education -- Single Sex Schools in New York City: DPC has been meeting with the White House Counsel's office, the Education and Justice Departments, to address the OCR response to a complaint against the existence of the all girl's Women's Leadership Academy in New York City.|1||0.969518006|9.01E-06
D1|Both you and Secretary Riley are in complete agreement that, as a matter of policy, school districts should be (encouraged??? free???) to establish single sex schools as part of the mix of education options.|1||0.950479627|0.9335097
D1|The Office of Civil Rights has placed its investigation of the compliant on hold, and will take no steps in the foreseeable future to press New York City to change the status of the school.|1||-0.989940226|9.32E-05
D1|However, civil rights offices in both Education and Justice believe that such schools ultimately may be difficult to justify under Title IX or Article (relevant Constitutional reference), in part because they have discriminatory admissions policies, and partly because separate schools will inevitably become unequal and to the ultimate disadvantage of females.|1||-0.923715413|3.68E-05
D1|They believe that the strongest legal case for permitting single sex schools is an argument that they are an appropriate remedy for past discrimination, such as low academic performance of females in co-educational settings.|1||0.586974144|0.7044363
D1|Neither of the cognizant Civil Rights offices want to take formal action on this issue, because they believe they will be forced to oppose single-sex schools.|1||-0.999092579|0.7952869
|||||
D1|Late in December, Secretary Riley and Rudy Crew agreed to appoint small teams of educators from the Education Department and the NYC Schools to work collaboratively to develop the strongest case for the Women's Leadership Academy.|1||0.964397728|3.04E-11
D1|The teams will begin to plan their work next week.|1||0.99241966|1.56E-05
D1|This process may take some time, and during this period the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights will not take any further actions on this case.|1||-0.997180343|0.04812624

D1|Health Care-- Robert Reich's Proposal for Fixed Dollars for Health Care:    You asked for an analysis of Robert Reich's proposal to forgo a new increase in the minimum wage and instead require that employers require a certain fixed dollar amount for health care.|1||-0.852508605|0.99991643
D1|As you will recall, we did forgo proposing a minimum wage increase when we proposed the Health Security Act because we did not want to load up the costs to employers.|1||-0.893057227|0.99894863
D1|The idea of having a defined minimum employer contribution certainly has some merit as it would make a significant contribution to decreasing the number of uninsured.|1||-0.866120756|0.9999256
D1|Having said that, there are a number of political and policy issues that have to be seriously considered prior to pursuing such a proposal.|1||-0.927915573|0.11513595
|||||
D1|There are numerous political and administrative complications that would have to be worked out before moving fonvard on such an initiative, such as: (1) whether or not we would be forced to add subsidies for this;|1||-0.942307591|0.078995295
D1|(2) whether employers would be accountable if their employees had coverage from their spouse's employers;|1||-0.81438899|2.56E-07
D1|or (3) whether certain employers would be exempt.|1||-0.758258164|9.50E-05
|||||
D1|Having said this, if you would like to further pursue this you should be aware that of some of the disadvantages.|1||0.848766744|0.9956756
D1|"We will have to use a great deal of capital with the employer community as we move forward on our other current health care policies such as health care quality and the COBRA extension for the ""promise breaker'' employees who have dropped retiree health care coverage."|1||-0.988729417|0.6388011
D1|Adding this proposal to the mix would no doubt create a great deal of public animosity from the employer community.|1||0.813843071|0.97462034
D1|"Moreover, in a Republican Congress there is no chance that this would pass and it would likely be characterized as another step to ""take over the health care system."""|1||-0.989677429|0.9183137
D1|Although liberal Democrats would be comfortable with this proposal, our centrist Democrats would not support it, primarily because of the opposition from the small business community.|1||-0.997479498|0.9959383

D1|Health Care -- Medicare HMOs Dropping Benefits: You asked us to respond to recent reports that Medicare lIMOs were dropping benefits because of changes in Medicare reimbursement policies.|1||-0.976244926|0.99998796
D1|We have asked HI-IS to review the extent to which this is occurring.|1||-0.991835237|0.98406905
D1|However, it is important to note that many independent policy experts believe that payments to HMOs still are, on average, excessive given the fact that they continue to attract disproportionately healthy populations.|1||-0.967582107|0.99741924
D1|They believe that any movement towards reducing 2 benefits are more attributable to HMO ' s desire for adequate profit margins for their investors rather than adjustments in reimbursement issue.|1||-0.988248169|0.9463474
D1|In fact, one corporate executive just informed us that Medicare continues to be their number one most profitable player.|1||-0.845475376|0.21786223
D1|Having said that, the fact that the BBA is starting to reduce Medicare reimbursements to HMOs will clearly contribute to lower revenues for these health plans.|1||-0.997054458|0.96645355
D1|It is important to note that the added benefits in Medicare HMO plans do help encourage beneficiaries to participate in these plans.|1||0.982626617|0.45341372
D1|The outstanding question is whether or not we want to allow payment rates to exceed what is necessary so as to ensure that these additional benefits are in place.|1||0.664503634|0.9997112
D1|Regardless , any move in this direction would be premature until we have better information about the extent to which HMOs are reducing benefits and the reasons behind such a trend.|1||0.598649204|0.9992914

D0|The Administration Announces Actions Responding to President Clinton's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments March 28, 1997|||-0.920228124|0.015478944
|||||
D0|Background In January, 1994 President Clinton established the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) to examine reports that the government had supported unethical human radiation experiments and releases of radiation during the Cold War.|||-0.652482867|2.55E-06
D0|He asked ACHRE to uncover the truth, recommend ways to right past wrongs, and suggest ways to make sure the government will not repeat past mistakes.|||-0.5279423|0.05803322
|||||
D0|In October, 1995 ACHRE issued its report.|||-0.915437996|0.04024369
D0|ACHRE found that the-government had conducted several thousand human radiation experiments from 1945 to 1975 and that the majority advanced biomedical research.|||-0.998028934|5.09E-05
D0|The Committee found, however, that some were conducted unethically.|||-0.991425037|0.48645607
D0|For example, scientists injected plutonium into 18 patients without their knowledge, and researchers conducted experiments on indigent patients and children.|||-0.998929799|0.000473652
D0|ACHRE made 18 recommendations to open the public record, protect human subjects of future research, and compensate those wronged by the government's actions.|||0.946806192|0.2491481
|||||
D0|"In October, 1995 the President received the Advisory Committee's report and made it clear that the report would ""not be left on a shelf to gather dust"" He directed his Cabinet to ""use and build on these recommendations."""|||-0.903723955|0.002341933
D0|Over the past year and a half, the Administration has acted to implement ACHRE's recommendations to improve openness in government, strengthen ethics in human subjects research, and compensate individuals for the government's mistakes.|||0.975571334|0.5232958

D0|Today's Announcement     â€¢ The Administration released Building Public Trust, outlining its comprehensive response to the President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE).|||0.992132008|0.8659305

D0|The government has settled with all 16 families that came forward.|||0.979563057|0.000813166

D0|â€¢ President Clinton signed a memorandum to strengthen the rights and protections of people participating in secret, government-supported research.|||0.919237256|0.018632147
D0|ACHRE recommended that subjects of secret experiments have special protections and information.|||0.923922956|0.07663699
D0|Acting on that recommendation, the President directed agencies today to propose new rules for secret research that would require scientists to: obtain informed consent from all potential subjects of all secret experiments (current rules allow researchers to waive informed consent in certain cases);|||0.755657017|3.87E-07
D0|disclose the identity of the sponsoring agency to potential subjects;|||0.938800335|6.44E-05
D0|and tell potential subjects that an experiment is classified.|||0.986750782|0.002485713
D0|The new rules would also establish a more independent review process;|||0.915517271|0.14964963
D0|require the head of the agency conducting secret human research to approve each project;|||-0.95748198|0.000389262
D0|and require permanent records of secret experiments.|||-0.997559667|0.002323946
D0|The President also directed federal agencies to report annually on the number of classified human research projects and the number of subjects in each project.|||-0.604080617|0.001717452

D0|ACHRE found that some deserving miners do not qualify for compensation under the Act.|||-0.998414159|0.99254566
D0|The amendments would establish fairer, scienceÂ­ based criteria for compensation.|||-0.979290664|0.84295267

D0|The Committee's report included recommendations to make the record of these experiments open to the public, improve ethics in human research  today, and right the wrongs of the past inflicted on unknowing citizens.||1|0.954233527|0.15175708
D0|In my remarks when I accepted the report, I promised that it would not be left  on the shelf to gather dust.||1|-0.995999455|0.6042331
D0|I made a commitment that we would learn from the lessons that the Committee's report offered and use it as a road map  to lead us to better choices in the future.||1|0.991665065|0.971032
|||||
D0|This document -- my Administration's response to the Advisory Committee's report -- is a milestone in meeting that commitment.||1|0.999136627|0.99876827
D0|We have actively worked to respond to the important recommendations made by the  Advisory Committee through a special interagency working group.||1|0.998620152|0.009273233
D0|This group includes representatives from the Executive Office of the President, the Departments of Energy, Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, Veterans Affairs, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Central Intelligence Agency.||1|0.989692867|7.30E-09
D0|The Environmental Protection Agency has also joined the effort.||1|0.940657735|0.001183367
D0|This report reflects the joint progress of these agencies to address the Advisory Committee's recommendations.||1|0.996888101|0.14066
|||||
D0|My Administration has made significant achievements in opening government and making information more easily available to the citizens to whom it belongs.||1|0.994405031|0.7152717
D0|Agencies have also improved the protections in place for    subjects  of  future human research.||1|0.709685385|0.00079208
D0|Finally, the Federal government is providing redress to those who have suffered from radiation experiments, as recommended by the Advisory Committee.||1|0.908867121|1.12E-06
|||||
D0|I emphasize that this document is by no means the end of the journey.||1|0.674457431|0.9630334
D0|Much work remains to  be done.||1|-0.575579166|0.6370718
D0|I am confident that all of us -- the eminent committee that produced the original report, the Federal officials who worked so hard to support the Committee's efforts and now are implementing its recommendations, and most importantly, the citizens of this great country from whose experiences  we have learned  so much -- can together help ensure a better world for our children.||1|0.999256074|0.99555993

D0|President Clinton took steps today to protect those who participate in secret, government-sponsored experiments from mistreatment and assure they are fully informed of the risks.||1|0.845959008|2.09E-05
D0|The administration also said it has settled the last of a number of claims, totalling $6.5 million, from families of civilians who were injected with plutonium or uranium as part of secret experiments in the 1940s.||1|-0.74211067|0.14690596
D0|"The actions are designed to increase public trust ... and make our government accountable to the American people,"" said Energy Secretary Federico Pena, whose department has spearheaded the public review of past radiation experiments."||1|0.580691576|0.56119365
D0|Pena said the administration also will ask Congress to expand a program that provides compensation to uranium miners who were exposed to radiation as part of the government nuclear weapons program.||1|-0.990297258|0.8900639
D0|He said up to 600 additional miners would be compensated at a cost of about $ 50 million.||1|-0.978966355|0.002517003
D0|The plans for giving greater protection to research participants were prompted by recommendations more than a year ago by a presidential commission that investigated the government's use of humans in radiation research during the Cold War years.||1|-0.970083535|0.14296441
D0|The advisory panel warned that past excesses might be repeated unless there are new safeguards.||1|-0.982182801|0.9596472
D0|The White House said today that Clinton had signed a memorandum strengthening the rights and protections afforded individuals who agree to be subjects of secret, government-supported research.||1|-0.955581427|0.000834011
D0|The White House said a review by an interagency task force uncovered no government-supported classified human research at this time.||1|-0.989678025|0.000264062
D0|But officials acknowledged that formal accounting for such research needs to be improved.||1|-0.987140894|0.8202372
D0|Meanwhile, the White House said it had settled claims with four additional families of 1B individuals who were given plutonium injections as part of 1940s experiments.||1|-0.964575887|0.000477317
D0|One victim has not been located and the family of another does not want compensation, said Tara O'Toole, DOE's assistant secretary for environment, safety and health.||1|-0.989945233|1.78E-07
D0|Associate  Attorney  General  John Dwyer  said the 16 claims 12 of which  totalling  $4.B million  were  made  public last November  total $6.5 million.||1|-0.977056682|0.000571717
D0|The government has said it is prepared to provide compensation to the families of 52 other individuals who the advisory commission said were believed to be subjected to improper radiation experiments.||1|-0.991943002|0.022671476
D0|The identity of those 52 are not known, and so far no families have come forward, according to the White House.||1|-0.995696783|0.003051148
D0|Under the new presidential directive on human research, agencies must develop new rules that clearly require scientists to obtain informed consent from all potential subjects of secret experiments.||1|0.664552212|0.000581612
D0|Currently, such consent may be waived under some circumstances.||1|0.667052627|0.01765116
D0|The president also ordered that any research subject be told the identity of the sponsoring agency and whether the experimentation is classified.||1|-0.995042205|0.002683352
D0|The new rules also would require the head of the agency to approve such research and develop a more independent review process than currently provided.||1|-0.941061258|0.7515445
D0|Also in response to the October 1995 findings by the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, the president said he will: Ask Congress to broaden a 1990 law that allows compensation to underground uranium miners who became ill because of exposure to radiation.||1|-0.936704636|2.82E-05
D0|Under current law, hundreds of miners are ineligible for compensation.||1|-0.996089816|0.000146893
D0|Will propose legislation to make veterans' health care benefits available to airmen and sailors who were subjects of radioactive nasal treatments more than 50 years ago.||1|0.880940139|0.017088769
D0|The treatments were to prevent broken eardrums during flight or in submarines.||1|0.871910393|0.03282815
D0|Will seek broader epidemiological studies to determine the long-term health impact of nuclear bomb testing during the Cold War to military personnel and civilian populations near the test areas.||1|-0.848466992|4.70E-06

D0|ACTIONS TO RESPOND TO THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RADIATION EXPERIMENTS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION) April 28, 1997|||0.940722644|0.9998863
|||||
D0|Overview of Advisory Committee Scope, Findings, and Recommendations|||0.999278486|0.92753357
|||||
D0|Q: What is the universe of experiments studied by the Advisory Committee?|||-0.924013317|0.1925834
|||||
D0|A: The President directed the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) to review government sponsored biomedical experiments on individuals involving intentional exposure to ionizing radiation, focusing on the period from 1944 until 1974.|||0.891039729|0.000188947
D0|The Committee did not consider common clinical practices that involved incidental exposures to ionizing radiation (e.g. x-rays).|||-0.993631899|0.46213803
|||||
D0|The President's charge also covered intentional releases of ionizing radiation designed to test human health effects or to measure the extent of human exposure.|||-0.99875164|0.66435313
D0|The Committee studied a number of populations exposed to radiation during the government's Cold War activities, including veterans of atomic test blasts, western uranium miners, and residents of the Marshall Islands.|||0.990677476|5.60E-06
|||||
D0|Q: How many experiments does this include?|||-0.957104146|0.582866
|||||
D0|A: No one knows exactly how many experiments this includes.|||0.808178484|0.88971937
D0|The Advisory Committee reported that the government had sponsored several thousand human radiation experiments between 1945 and 1974.|||-0.842290461|7.61E-06
|||||
D0|Q:How many people were involved in these experiments?|||-0.998081923|0.40171796
|||||
D0|A: Because only fragmentary information has survived about many of these experiments it was not possible for the Advisory Committee to estimate how many people were involved.|||-0.986878812|0.93783337
|||||
D0|Q:How many people were harmed in the experiments?|||-0.998905182|0.5405601
|||||
D0|A: The Advisory Committee was not in a position to answer this question completely.|||-0.999108136|0.92659193
D0|In general, the Committee found that the majority of experiments they studied involved trace amounts of radiation given to adults, similar to those used in research today.|||-0.999842644|0.000421793
D0|These were unlikely to have caused physical harm.|||-0.930977285|0.000843023
D0|The Committee identified several groups of experiments that may have increased individuals' risks, including total body irradiation experiments on ill patients and iodine-1 31 experiments involving children.|||-0.916060328|9.82E-05
|||||
D0|Q: How many people were not informed in advance that they were the subject of an experiment?|||-0.999720275|0.65474635
|||||
D0|A: Only very limited documentation about consent in individual experiments has survived and no estimates can be made.|||-0.999599278|0.99645007
D0|Generally, the Committee found that researchers obtained consent from healthy subjects, but not from patient-subjects.|||-0.98892349|0.000942941
D0|The Advisory Committee did look more broadly at issues of informed consent across the government and found that the government did not have comprehensive policies in place before 1974.|||-0.975437999|0.022790078
D0|Although the government has strengthen informed consent procedures significantly since 1974, the Committee recommended -- and the Administration is taking -- additional steps to improve informed consent, including requiring informed consent in all classified research (eliminating a current waiver provision) and studying further the informed consent process.|||0.904106855|1.38E-05
|||||
D0|Q: What did the Advisory Committee recommend?|||-0.940786123|0.5816337
|||||
D0|A: The Committee made 18 recommendations to open the record to the public, compensate those who were wronged, and protect human subjects of future research.|||0.991639197|0.34178293
|||||
D0|Q: What has the Administration done to respond?|||-0.990499794|0.9484818
|||||
D0|A: The Administration has already taken steps in each of these areas.|||0.966537476|0.52582496
D0|For example, to open up the record, the Administration has put thousands of pages of documents on the Internet and in the National Archives, and has developed document search guides.|||0.776159763|0.001056135
D0|To better protect human subjects in the future, the President established the National Bioethics Advisory Committee (NBAC) and asked NBAC to examine many of the questions raised by ACHRE.|||-0.855422378|7.75E-06
D0|To redress the wrongs of the past, the President apologized to subjects of radiation experiments and their families, and agencies have worked hard to settle compensation claims.|||-0.959180951|4.20E-06
D0|These and many other actions responding to the Committee's recommendations are outlined in the report released today.|||0.981883168|0.16138655
|||||
D0|Today the Administration also announced two new actions -- the President is issuing a directive strengthening protections for subjects of classified research, and the Administration is proposing legislation to improve compensation for uranium miners.|||-0.917696655|0.16583566
|||||
D0|Q: Are current protections for subjects of human research inadequate?|||-0.993666947|0.65250885
|||||
D0|A: A strong system of Federal oversight, education, and sanctions is currently in place to ensure the protection of the subjects of government sponsored human research.|||0.934303224|0.31814814
D0|The Administration has taken a number of steps to further strengthen protections for human subjects based on the Advisory Committee's recommendations.|||0.522322774|0.2483851
D0|For example, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission is reviewing Institutional Review Board policies -- IRBs are the local boards that review the ethics of individual research projects.|||-0.89355123|0.85765636
D0|And today the President signed a directive to protect subjects of classified research.|||-0.955873251|4.76E-05
|||||
D0|The Administration is also working to improve the informed consent process.|||0.816994965|0.003712766
D0|Despite the vigor with which all parties embrace the informed consent process, the Advisory Committee found that little is actually known about the effectiveness of this transaction between researcher and prospective subject.|||-0.950790644|0.90936977
D0|In response, the NIH and the Departments of Energy and Veterans Affairs are initiating research to develop new knowledge about the informed consent process.|||0.924106598|0.000299595
|||||
D0|Q: Now that the National Bioethics Advisory Commission has been given a special assignment on cloning, does this mean that there will be a delay in addressing protection of human research subjects.|||-0.999317765|0.9336685
|||||
D0|A: No.|||-0.999829173|0.67469716
D0|the National Bioethics Advisory Commission has already established an ambitious plan of work to address the current status of Federal protection for human research subjects.|||0.993224442|0.017090883
D0|The work will proceed in parallel with the special assignment on cloning.|||0.967289329|0.050989684
D0|NBAC is planning to issue a report to the President and to Congress in October and hopes that little or no delay will be incurred as a result of the additional work.|||-0.824196696|0.23502587
|||||
D0|Q: What is being done to provide compensation in connection with the human radiation experiments?|||-0.977823019|0.4733185
|||||
D0|A: The Advisory Committee recommended the government compensate or consider compensate subjects of certain biomedical experiments.|||0.789978504|0.39469847
D0|The Department of Justice has worked closely with other Departments to resolve individual claims.|||0.943626642|1.60E-06
D0|As announced today, the Administration has resolved all claims brought forward for experiments the Advisory Committee specifically identified for compensation.|||0.995942295|0.000151522
D0|The Administration has settled with families of 16 plutonium injection subjects.|||-0.933429658|0.845614
D0|The plutonium injection cases were singled out by the Advisory Committee as being particularly troubling ethically and deserving of compensation because efforts were made by the government to keep information secret from the subjects or their families to avoid government liabilities or embarrassment.|||-0.966970325|0.9970824
D0|The Advisory Committee also identified two other experiments for compensation (see Recommendation 1 ), but the subjects of those experiments are unknown.|||-0.518452287|1.42E-06
|||||
D0|Several other experiments were identified by the Advisory Committee for consideration for possible compensation, subject to further development of the facts surrounding the experiments.|||-0.642881989|0.000227168
D0|That fact-finding continues in a number of these cases.|||0.986033976|0.031852856
D0|[Refer detailed questions to DoJ].|||-0.68566215|0.9710472
|||||
D0|Some populations exposed to radiation releases studied by the Committee are already eligible for compensation under existing law, including atomic vets and uranium miners.|||-0.980669558|0.00039236
D0|The Committee recommended certain changes to these programs.|||0.924991488|0.7374747
D0|The Administration has reviewed and acted on those recommendations.|||0.985830724|0.8682547
D0|For example, today we are announcing new legislation to improve compensation for uranium miners.|||-0.994172513|0.38730192
|||||
D1|I will be out of the office most of Monday, Feb. 3 (10:30-4:30), and all of Monday,  Feb.  1O for medical school interviews.|||-0.953651249|4.64E-06
D1|Mike and I think the Wed. educ. roundtable is in good shape, so I don't anticipate any conflicts with these dates.|||0.98129499|0.99967754
D1|Any idea when/if you will want to resurrect radiation report/eo on classified research?|1||-0.999756753|0.3726103
|||||
D0|Thanks for you help on the radiation issue.|||0.820800722|0.8706772
D0|Your thoughts helped to stimulate a productive discussion with DOJ on alternative approaches.|||0.997652829|0.91526
|||||
D1|DOJ and I are planning to put a revised proposal into 0MB review on Friday.|1||-0.918943286|0.99509674
D1|The new approach quantifies uncertainties in the claims process, and proposes to give the miners the benefit of the doubt in resolving the uncertainties.|1||0.99878341|0.9464353
D1|This approach avoids the precedential issue that DOJ was concerned about, while expanding the number of miners eligible for compensation.|1||0.999084949|0.9997191
D1|(Miners who fall within this approach would still get partial compensation.)|1||-0.960143566|0.33742306

D0|Please let me know if you wish to discuss this.|||-0.648410976|0.9337437

D0|White House Press Release In Acceptance Of Human Radiation Final Report|||-0.723452091|0.001121471
|||||
D0|For Immediate Release   October 3, 1995 Remarks By The President In Acceptance  Of    Human Radiation Final Report  Old Executive Office Building||1|-0.942537487|0.000128552
|||||
D0|The President:  Let me begin with a simple thank you to everyone who participated in this extraordinary project and to everyone who supported them.||1|0.918554425|0.5233498
|||||
D0|I am especially glad to see here today Senator Glenn, who's been so active in working on medical ethics issue, Congressman Markey, whoâ€™s worked  on this  issue  for  a  very long time;||1|0.997688055|0.08762297
D0|Congressman Frost, Secretary  Shalala, Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs Herschel Goqer, and of course, the Attorney General who basically tries to get us all to do the right thing all the time.||1|0.91956979|8.42E-05
|||||
D0|I want to thank Secretary O'Leary for her extraordinary devotion to this cause.||1|0.973589838|0.7513562
D0|And you heard in her remarks  basically the way that she views this.||1|0.783017457|0.25401837
D0|It's a part of her ongoing         commitment to finish the end of the Cold War.||1|0.998364508|0.6973029
D0|And perhaps no  Energy Secretary has ever done as much as she has to be an advocate, whether it is for continued reforms within the Energy Department or her outspoken endorsement of the strongest possible commitment on the  part of the United States to a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which I believe we will achieve next year in no small measure thanks to the support  of the Secretary of Energy.||1|0.898396373|0.9934401
|||||
D0|And, of course, I want to thank Dr. Ruth Faden for her extraordinary commitment of about a year and a half of her life to this unusual but important task.||1|0.997431576|0.014924733
|||||
D0|And all of you who servedÂ·on the committee -- I remember the first  time we put this committee together.||1|0.985891759|0.37938038
D0|I looked -- I said, that's a pretty distinguished outfit.||1|0.922941387|0.99885964
D0|I wish I could give them five or six jobs to do.||1|0.813505471|0.1030918
D0|(Laughter.)||1|0.99914372|0.93775284
D0|I'll expect you back next Monday and then we'll (laughter).||1|-0.864095867|0.9838299
D0|I do thank you so much for the work you have done.||1|0.960411012|0.99762076
|||||
D0|Let me tell you that, just  as      this is an important part of the efforts that Secretary O'Leary outlined, I saw this committee as.||1|0.99135989|0.99546486
D0|an indispensable part of our effort to restore the confidence of the American people in the integrity of their government.||1|0.99864608|0.93246436
D0|All of these political reform issues to me are integrated.||1|0.999131382|0.28886926
D0|When I became the President, I realized we had great new economic challenges, we had profound social problems, that a lot of these things had to be done by an energized American citizenry, but that our national government had   role to play in moving our country through this period of transition.||1|0.997351408|0.88856465
D0|And in order to do it, we needed to increase the capacity of the government to do it through political reform, but we also needed, as much as anything else, to increase the confidence of the American people that, at the very least, they could trust the United States government to tell the truth and to do the right things.||1|0.872319281|0.96967363
|||||
D0|So you have to understand that, for me, one reason this is so important is that I see it as part of our ongoing effort to give this government back to the American people -- Senator Glenn's long effort to get Congress to apply to itself the same laws it imposes on the private sector;||1|0.975887954|0.9998124
D0|the restrictions that I imposed on members of my administration in high positions for lobbying for foreign governments;||1|-0.963579476|0.015452282
D0|and when the lobby bill failed in the Congress, I just imposed it by executive order on members of the Executive Branch.||1|-0.986002922|1.63E-05
D0|All these efforts at political reform, it seems to me, are important.||1|0.997202396|0.7639327
|||||
D0|But none of these efforts can succeed unless people believe  that     they  can rely  on their       government to  tell  them the truth and to do the right thing.||1|-0.994235337|0.12466444
D0|We have declassified thousands of government documents,  files from second world war, the Cold War, President Kennedy's assassination.||1|0.810653806|0.000114635
D0|These   actions are not only consistent with our national security, they are essential to advance our values.||1|0.99843508|0.32956728
|||||
D0|So, to me, that's what this is all about.||1|-0.996986687|0.9763865
D0|And to all those who represent the families who have been involved in these incidents, let me say to you, I hope you feel that your government has kept its commitment to the American people to tell the truth and to do the right thing.||1|0.997183621|0.027210481
|||||
D0|We discovered soon after I entered office that  with the specter of an atomic war looming like Armageddon far nearer than it does today, the   United States government  actually did  carry out          on our citizens experiments involving radiation.||1|-0.680650175|0.8832036
D0|That's when I ordered the creation of this committee.||1|0.961227357|0.504221
D0|Dr. Faden and the others did a superb job.||1|0.999522567|0.5936767
D0|They enlisted many of our nation's most significant  and important medical and scientific-ethicists.||1|0.999242187|0.000391672
D0|They had to determine first whether experiments conducted or sponsored by our government between 1944 and 1974 met the ethical and scientific standards of that time and of our time.||1|0.992466509|2.53E-08
D0|And then they had to see to it that our research today lives up to nothing less than our highest values and our most deeply-held beliefs.||1|0.970764041|0.01539111

D0|From the beginning, it was obvious to me that this energetic committee was prepared  to do its part.||1|0.992639661|0.9761179
D0|We declassified thousands  of pages of documents.||1|-0.995339036|0.43441582
D0|We gave committee members  the keys to the  government's  doors, file cabinets and safes.||1|0.978241086|0.023522075
D0|For the last year and a half, the only thing that stood between them and the truth were all the late nights and hard work they had to put in.||1|-0.993748307|0.002172218

D0|This report I received today is a monumental document (laughter) --  in more ways than one.||1|0.991266787|0.99943143
D0|But it is a very, very important piece of America's history, and it will shape America's future in ways that will make us a more honorable, more successful and more ethical country.||1|0.998838246|0.99966264

D0|What this committee learned I would like to review today with a little more detail than Dr. Faden said, because I think it must be engraved on our national memory.||1|0.998104095|0.99877626
D0|Thousands of government-sponsored experiments did take place at hospitals, universities and military bases around our nation.||1|-0.712216079|4.91E-07
D0|The goal was to understand the effects of radiation exposure on the human body.||1|0.870466113|0.35261938
|||||
D0|While most of the tests were ethical by any standards, some were unethical, not only by today's standards, but by the standards of the time in which they were conducted.||1|-0.996749163|0.5669225
D0|They failed both the test of our national values and the test of humanity.||1|-0.996152341|6.29E-05
|||||
D0|In one experience, scientists -- experiment -Â­ scientists injected plutonium into 18 patients without their knowledge.||1|-0.999768794|0.353249
D0|In another, doctors exposed indigent cancer patients to excessive doses of radiation, a treatment from which it is virtually impossible that they could ever benefit.||1|-0.999671459|0.9944449
|||||
D0|The report also demonstrates that these and other experiments were carried out on precisely those citizens who count most: on the government for its help the destitute and the gravely ill.||1|0.652902722|0.025016434
D0|But the dispossessed were not alone.||1|-0.853697002|0.015691966
D0|Members of the military -- precisely those on whom we and our government count most -- they were also test subjects.||1|0.993186235|0.9405677

D0|Informed consent means your doctor tells you the risk of the treatment you are about to undergo.||1|0.554965317|0.09541309
D0|In too many cases, informed consent                  was withheld.||1|-0.990767121|0.06819484
D0|Americans   were kept in the dark about the effects of what was being  done to them.||1|-0.991189241|0.012557107
D0|The deception extended beyond the test subjects themselves to encompass their families and i the American people as awhole, for these experiments were kept secret.||1|-0.784809828|0.0366504
D0|And  they were shrouded  not for a compelling  reason of  national security, but for the simple fear of embarrassment, and that was wrong.||1|-0.994387329|0.027427392
|||||
D0|Those who led the government when these decisions were made are no longer here to take responsibility for what they did.||1|0.804893196|0.002214034
D0|They are not here to apologize to the survivors, the family members or the communities who's lives were darkened by the shadow of the atom and these choices||1|-0.539814293|1.84E-05
|||||
D0|So today, on behalf of another generation of American leaders and another generation of American citizens, the united States of America offers a sincere apology to those of our citizens who were subjected to these experiments, to their families, and to their communities.||1|0.994216025|5.69E-05
|||||
D0|When the government does wrong, we have a moral responsibility to admit it.||1|0.980678618|0.3060616
D0|The duty we owe to one another to tell the truth and  to protect our fellow citizens from excesses like these is one we  can never walk away from.||1|0.991176367|0.13052665
D0|Our government failed in that duty, and it offers an apology  to the survivors  and their families  and to all the American  people who must -- who  must be able to rely upon the United States to keep its word, to tell the truth, and to do the right thing.||1|-0.84920013|0.011383507
|||||
D0|We know there are  moments  when words alone are not enough.||1|0.973417342|0.99954647
D0|That's why I am instructing my Cabinet to use and build on these recommendations, to devise promptly  a  system of relief, including compensation, that meets the standards of justice and conscience.||1|0.985330105|0.37034297
|||||
D0|When called for, we will work with Congress to serve the best needs of those who were harmed.||1|0.990157127|9.22E-05
D0|Make no mistake, as the committee report says, there are circumstances where compensation is appropriate as a matter of ethics and principle.||1|0.936709046|0.9850936
D0|I am committed to seeing to it that the United States of America lives up to its responsibility.||1|0.996451259|0.86712027

D0|Our greatness  is measured  not only in how we so frequently do right, but  also how we act when we know we've done the wrong thing;||1|0.994271636|0.99850994
D0|how we confront our mistakes, make our apologies, and take action,||1|0.999282181|0.77776724
|||||
D0|That's why this morning, I signed an executive order instructing every arm and agency of our government that conducts, supports or regulates research involving human beings to review immediately their procedures, in light of the recommendations of this report, and the best knowledge and standards available today, and to report back to me by Christmas.||1|0.872476816|0.011730076
|||||
D0|I have also created a Bioethics Advisory Commission to supervise the process, to watch over all such research, and to see to it that never again do we stray from   the basic values of potecting our people and being straight with them;||1|0.9545452|0.17660616

D0|The report I received today will not be left on a shelf to gather dust.||1|-0.999707639|0.08077328
D0|Every one of its pages offers a lesson, and every lesson will be learned from these good people who put a year and a half of their lives into the effort to set America straight.||1|0.897790313|0.95750767

D0|Medical and scientific progress depends upon learning about people's responses to new medicines, to new cutting-edge treatments.||1|-0.915992916|0.6996447
D0|Without this kind of research, our children would still be dying from polio and other killers.||1|0.67297703|0.002242623
D0|Without responsible radiation research, we wouldn't be making the progress we are in thewar on cancer.||1|-0.993524313|0.9865269
D0|We have to continue to research, but there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.||1|-0.514211357|0.8872871

D0|There are local citizens' review boards, there are regulations that establish proper informed consent and ensure that experiments are conducted ethically.||1|0.948965132|0.09897384
D0|But in overseeing this necessary research, we must never relax our vigilance.||1|-0.951013207|0.24853735

D0|The breathtaking advances in science and technology demand that we always keep our ethical watchlight burning.||1|0.997232974|0.9891206
D0|No matter how rapid the pace of change, it can never outrun our core convictions that have stood us so well as a nation for more than 200 years now, through many different scientific revolutions.||1|0.998130858|0.9998921

D0|I believe we will meet the test of our  times -- that as and technology evolve, our ethical conscience will grow, not Informed consent, community right-to-know, our entire of essential human    protections -- all these grew up in response They are to the health and humanitarian crises of this 20th century.||1|0.995092034|0.21371165

D0|Let us remember, too, that  cynicism about government has roots in historical circumstances.||1|0.985776722|0.9857475
D0|Because of stonewallings and evasions in the past times when a family member or a neighbor suffered an injustice and had nowhere to turn and couldn't even get the facts, some Americans lost faith in the promise of our democracy.||1|-0.998644412|0.018592162
D0|Government was very powerful, but very far away and not trusted to be ethical.||1|-0.996985853|0.5693922

D0|So today, by making ourselves accountable  for the sins of the past;||1|0.975537837|0.6599595

D0|We expect to announce the Administration's response to the Presidential Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments next week.|||-0.943296671|0.40675712
D0|As part of that announcement, the staff is recommending legislation to amend the Radiation Exposure and Compensation Act of 1990 (RECA).|||0.668029964|0.002964616
D0|There is one outstanding issue with respect to the Administration's bill and,  on Friday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) asked us to seek your  view of  the change  before going ahead.|||-0.840437233|0.004028152
|||||
D0|ISSUE: Should the Administration propose any compensation for uranium miners with lung cancer where the probability is between 20%-50% that their cancer was caused by government's failure to appropriately ventilate the mines?|||-0.999396086|0.96080744
|||||
D0|BACKGROUND:|||0.848831415|0.7563657
D0|From the 1940s to the 1960s the United States' nuclear weapons program relied on uranium from mines in the Southwestern United States.|||-0.978786647|6.29E-07
D0|Miners working in those mines were exposed to levels of radiation known to be dangerous  because the  United States did not ensure that the mines were adequately ventilated.|||-0.999645948|0.22052084
D0|As a result hundreds of miners contracted or will contract fatal lung cancer.|||-0.998679459|0.000382653
|||||
D0|The Radiation Exposure and Compensation  Act of 1990 (RECA)  provides  for compensation of some miners, as well as those living downwind of nuclear test  sites.|||0.787714422|0.3363056
D0|Uranium  miners qualify for $100,000 compensation if they were exposed to a certain amount of radiation and they contract lung cancer (almost always fatal).|||-0.994337857|0.016133765
|||||
D0|"The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) recommended that the President seek legislation that would ""provide compensation to all miners who develop lung cancer after some minimal duration of employment underground..."""|||-0.986100614|2.02E-05
D0|Their  recommendation was based, in part, on the conclusion that the actions of the United States with respect to the miners was egregious.|||-0.98307091|0.014831433
D0|The government knowingly allowed the miners to work under conditions likely to cause fatal cancers and neither warned the miners nor took action to mitigate the danger.|||-0.999263585|3.82E-05
D0|See ACHRE Final Report, pages 565-582.|||-0.837494493|0.72735023
|||||
D0|The Inter-Agency Working Group on Human Radiation (IAWG), chaired by DPC staff, has developed proposed legislation to respond to the ACHRE recommendations on RECA.|||0.884161532|0.003755578
D0|Different aspects of the proposal would address two different populations:|||-0.925644815|0.12952226
|||||
D1|Miners for whom the probability is greater  than 50%  that exposure  in the mines caused their disease.|||-0.999825776|0.009233044
D1|(The calculated  probability  is  population-based and does not account for individual susceptibility.)|||-0.999834776|0.6851832
D1|All agencies in the IAWG support proposing legislation that would affect these miners.|1||0.973941267|0.16523683
|||||
D1|Miners for whom the population analysis suggests that  the  probability  is less than 50% that mining exposure caused the disease.|||-0.999893665|0.6127299
D1|DOJ has expressed concern about proposing legislation that would compensate these miners.|1||-0.965228736|0.991895
|||||
D1|Miners with a Probability of Causation of Greater than 50%|||-0.99618113|0.19424945
|||||
D1|The legislative history suggests that Congress intended RECA to provide compensation to uranium miners for whom the probability that their illness was caused by radiation exposure while mining is greater than 50 percent.|||-0.998728573|0.06760011
D1|In these cases, RECA provides $100,000 in compensation per uranium miner.|||-0.971242845|0.07686023
D1|In practice, RECA does not accomplish this goal because documenting exact exposures is too difficult and because the scientific premises underlying RECA are not accurate.|||-0.999587476|0.992861
D1|Therefore the current law denies compensation to some miners who clearly should be eligible.|1||-0.993034482|0.006727659
|||||
D1|A working group of the Department of Justice and the National Cancer Institute analyzed the current compensation scheme and recommended changes to ensure that miners are eligible for compensation if it is more likely than not (probability  >50%)  that  their  lung cancer  was caused by exposure in the mines.|1||-0.722687602|4.14E-08
D1|The proposed measures provide new, less  burdensome methods for miners to establish that radiation  caused  their illness.|1||0.664728701|0.8763594
D1|The measures  also expand the list of compensable diseases, based on new scientific evidence.|1||0.881934941|0.3453433
|||||
D1|All departments in the IAWG agree that the Administration should propose these changes.|1||0.916925132|0.34907356
|||||
D1|Miners with a Probability of Causation of Less than 50%|||-0.998012662|0.65514046
|||||
D1|The AWG has also been considering a proposal to provide  partial  compensation  to miners for whom there is a significant probability that their lung cancer was caused by exposure in the mines, but the probability is less than 50%.|1||-0.990708113|0.99903226
D1|DOJ has voiced concerns about this proposal.|1||-0.873957992|0.9940684
|||||
D1|Option A:       Propose legislation to provide at least partial compensation ($50,000) to all miners for whom the probability is between 20% and 50% that  their  lung cancer was caused by exposure to radiation in uranium mines.|1||-0.96529603|0.001109803
D1|This approach would also include proposing the measures outlined in Section 1, above, for miners with greater than 50% probability.|1||-0.885943353|0.9995443
|||||
D1|Option B:       Limit the Administration's proposed legislation to compensation of miners with lung cancer for whom it is more probable  than not that  the cancer  was caused by exposure to radiation in uranium mines (i.e. only propose  measures outlined in Section 1 above).|1||-0.996918321|0.99990404
|||||
D1|OPTION A: Expanding compensation to miners should be viewed in the context of the Administration's response to ACHRE more generally.|1||0.764083803|0.9998822
D1|In responding to ACHRE, the Administration's policy has been to be as generous as is reasonable because the government's actions in these cases denied fair protection to individuals, and undermined democratic control over the government.|1||-0.999151707|0.999172
D1|According to ACHRE's chair, Dr. Ruth  Faden, expanded  compensation for uranium miners is one of the most strongly-felt of ACHRE's recommendations.|1||0.977562666|0.08288958
|||||
D1|ACHRE's recommendation to expand compensation without requiring individualized proof of causation is appropriate because of the egregiousness of the government's conduct, the impact  of the increased cancer rates in these communities and the government's  support for studying the miners without taking reasonable steps to reduce the known risk.|1||-0.767794073|0.9914518
|||||
D1|Without a change, uranium miners who are not now compensated  under RECA  will continue to be held to a higher standard of causation than others who are compensated under RECA.|1||0.972778201|0.97497034
D1|Under RECA, people living downwind  of certain areas are compensated  ($50,000) if they  get  a radiogenic disease--even though the probability is very low (<10%) that the disease  was caused by the government's action.|||-0.966766179|0.7790176
D1|In addition, because RECA is not currently based on a probabilistic standard, a significant number of uranium miners who fall within the 20%-50% probability range in Option A are already eligible for compensation.|||-0.998894155|0.9751129
D1|Option  A  would overcome some of these inequities.|1||0.83972615|0.90721375
|||||
D1|The Clinton Administration has, in certain cases, advocated compensation where there is less than a 50% probability that physical  harm  was caused  by  the government's  action.|||-0.994332552|0.9998671
D1|First, within the last two months, the government has compensated 13 experimental subjects, as recommended by ACHRE, without any causal link to physical disease.|||-0.816811144|0.00362485
D1|Second, the President announced that children of veterans  exposed  to agent orange  will  be compensated  with medical care if they are born with spina bifida.|||-0.999240398|2.84E-07
D1|This decision  was tnade despite the extremely low probability of a connection and in the absence of biological plausibility. Â·|||-0.99170953|0.9935528
|||||
D1|Our current best estimate of the total additional cost of this proposal  combined  with  the changes to RECA that we have already agreed upon is between $13 and $14 million over  the next 20 years.|1||0.658627152|0.99636143
D1|The expected cost of option A is only a fraction of this amount.|1||-0.985279918|0.99934715
|||||
D1|Outside of the DPC staff, this option is strongly supported by DOE.|1||0.984662056|0.005487434
D1|I expect that OSTP will also support this option, and OMB will express a view within the next day or so.|1||-0.952442646|0.9859136
|||||
D1|OPTION B: (A memo from DOJ making a full argument on this point is attached.]|1||-0.969683647|0.99214196
|||||
D1|The general rule in litigation should remain that the government will only pay compensation if it is more likely than not that the government's action caused the harm.|1||-0.987800002|0.9998516
D1|Any  decision  to expand the government's liability to other cases is setting a bad precedent.|1||-0.999064982|0.9123868
D1|The possible result will be further expansion of the government's liability within RECA--possibly to new populations--and the creation of a model that may be used in entirely different circumstances.|1||-0.992413461|0.9990023
|||||
D1|This option is supported by DOJ.|1||0.583843827|0.68579865

D0|PUBLIC REACTION:|||0.76668632|0.8663857
D0|Stuart Udall, former Secretary of the Interior and his clients, mostly Navaho, are likely to react strongly if  the  Administration does not  propose  some compensation for most miners with lung cancer.|||-0.975972235|0.038984623
D0|I expect they will have some success in the New Mexico Congressional Delegation and with the Governor.|||0.875677705|0.009490778
D0|The decision on this issue, however, is unlikely to affect the overall reception of the Administration's response  to ACHRE.|||0.836203992|0.99057466

D1|I recommend that you support Option A. Whatever your decision, OMB will inform key Departments to determine whether any Department wishes to request a principals meeting to discuss this issue further.|1||0.950398505|0.96352446

D0|This responds to your request for the views of the Civil Division on the amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) which would authorize the payment of partial compensation to uranium miners for whom the probability is 50\ or less that their lung cancer was caused by exposure to radiation in the mines.|||-0.58020103|0.17446123

D1|First, we support the other proposed amendments to RECA because we believe they will result in a fairer program for the claimants.|1||-0.925723135|0.97903067
D1|We helped to develop many of these proposals based on our experience in administering the program.|1||0.995505095|0.7277359
D1|We have worked hard to improve the administration of the program and are proud of what we have achieved and fully support the bulk of what has been proposed.|1||0.992011011|0.9951427
D1|We feel, however, that we must object to one of the proposals.|1||-0.835507989|0.99492353

D1|The current RECA provisions authorize the payment of $100,000 in compensation to miners who demonstrate that they were exposed to defined minimum levels of radiation.|||-0.996722281|0.91149473
D1|The legislative history of RECA indicates that Congress set the minimum exposure levels to approximate the point where, on average, it was more likely than not the miner's exposure caused his lung cancer; i.e., where the probability of causation was greater than 50%.|||-0.999320269|0.9997036
D1|RECA also authorizes the payment of compensation in the amount $50,000 to downwinders, persons who demonstrate that they were physically present in certain specified counties or geographic areas in the States of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah  during periods when atmospheric testing was carried out at the Nevada Test Site, and who suffer from certain statutorily specified radiogenic cancers.|||-0.909578502|0.023849407
|||||
D1|we understand that because the minimum exposure levels currently specified in the statute do not accurately reflect a 50% probability of causation for most miners, the Department has proposed legislation to amend RECA to incorporate new, more accurate criteria.|1||-0.997930765|0.99999475
D1|We support these proposals.|1||0.98929137|0.960253
|||||
D1|One of the proposed amendments to RECA would add provisions authorizing the payment of compensation in the amount of $50,000 to uranium miners who demonstrate that they were exposed to levels of radiation in the mines at which the probability is only between 20% and 50% that their lung cancer was caused by exposure to radiation in the mines.|1||-0.995823026|0.8206958
|||||
D0|It is our understanding that the rationale for these proposed amendments is to more nearly equalize the treatment of uranium miners and downwinders.|||-0.970309258|0.98868495
D0|Scientific evidence indicates that downwinders were exposed to much lower levels of radiation and, therefore, a much smaller increased risk of cancer, than were uranium miners.|||-0.977641404|0.9779724
D0|Therefore, the argument goes, it is unfair to allow downwinders whose probability of causation is below 50% to recover compensation while denying such recovery to uranium miners.|||-0.998168945|0.7855584
|||||
D1|We believe this reasoning is flawed.|1||-0.986134827|0.9728792
D1|If the current scheme is providing payments to individuals whose illnesses more likely than not were not caused by radiation does not justify expanding payments to other individuals whose illnesses were not likely caused by radiation.|1||-0.998982131|0.99211556
D1|We do not believe the case has adequately been made to overcompensate the miners which would be favored by the proposed legislation.|1||-0.997264504|0.98321205
|||||
D1|Our main concern is that if this legislation is enacted, it can be anticipated that other groups will seek to be included in a similar way.|1||-0.931017995|0.99199593
D1|For example, the geographical limits on the downwinder population will be subject to expansion.|||-0.945524573|0.9503866
D1|The counties and geographic areas currently specified in the statute exclude persons in adjacent counties and geographic areas where they were exposed to comparable levels of radiation from the nuclear testing program.|||-0.987347245|5.90E-07
D1|Moreover, the costs of an expanding program are difficult to predict.|1||-0.982922792|0.42193416
D1|For instance, the initial assessment of the cost of the Black Lung Program proved to be dramatically low.|||-0.999074459|0.9990048
|||||
D1|Very importantly, expansion of the precedent for paying individuals compensation for injuries which, more likely than not, were not caused by the events triggering the compensation program is a profound policy decision.|1||0.999486446|0.9999362
D1|We would draw the policy line short of providing recovery for persons who probably were not injured by the government activities involved.|1||-0.989743292|0.44272792
D1|The rule in litigation is that those who sue the government for injuries caused by governmental action must prove that the injuries were caused by the governmental action.|1||0.910088897|0.010873278
D1|[This standard is encompassed in 28 use 1346(b)]|||-0.980498314|0.89665705
D1|In many of these cases the plaintiffs may have a sympathetic case but lack the evidence to prove causation by the preponderance standard.|||-0.99849093|0.99918836
D1|"Once the precedent is established that in some â€œexceptionable"" cases the government, although not legally liable, is willing to legislatively compensate claimants, it will be hard to justify denying compensation to one group of citizens having granted it to others."|1||-0.779663861|0.98436004
|||||
D1|Moreover, reducing the level of compensation does not derogate from the adverse consequences.|1||0.989084423|0.9689396
D1|The issue remains whether an individual should receive compensation for injuries most likely unrelated to the activities giving rise to the compensation.|1||-0.992814898|0.19033502
D1|The bottom line is the same, the government would provide compensation even though most of the claimants receiving compensation would be compensated for injuries unrelated to the government's conduct.|1||-0.994600892|0.9967514
D1|We believe the dangers of allowing compensation in these instances will invite many more such requests.|1||-0.994212806|0.89060587

D1|Having raised these concerns, we recognize that the decision of whether to bestow a new entitlement on a favored group is a policy call and acknowledge that this proposal will be considered by Congress which can weigh these risks in their consideration of the amendment.|1||0.983824015|0.98364383
D1|In administering many of these compensation programs and in generally defending the government against claims of aggrieved citizens, however, we believe that such an extension should not be proposed by the Administration.|1||-0.833575666|0.9977582
|||||
D1|We do not believe it is good public policy because it creates a new standard of compensation for one specific, favored group of citizens, which is not generally available to others whose claims may; in some instances, be equally or even more compelling.|1||-0.942870319|0.99999154
D1|"By making exceptions to certain favored groups rather than adhering to requirements equally applicable to everyone injured by the government, we will open a process in which groups may obtain relief more on the basis of their political ability than on the basis of an easily understood and accepted ""more likely than not"" standard."|1||-0.940158963|0.9973863

D0|NURSING HOME RESIDENT PROTECTION ACT|||0.991046846|0.9835752
|||||
D0|SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION|||0.854189813|0.9835752
D0|The proposed legislation would give DOJ three new tools to combat the failure of nursing homes and other residential health care facilities to treat residents properly.|||0.957021058|7.74E-05
D0|First, it creates criminal sanctions for organizations or individuals who knowingly and willfully engage  in a pattern of  physical  or mental harm to residents.|||-0.987427354|0.016467966
D0|Second, it would create civil penalties that could be imposed on individuals, facility chains, or management companies if they engage in conduct that results in a pattern of  physical  or mental harm to residents.|||-0.993247509|0.036296938
D0|Third,  it would authorize  DOJ to seek injunctive  relief  against these entities or individuals whenever DOJ has reason to suspect  that  they are engaging  in behavior  that  will  result in harm to physical or mental harm to residents.|||-0.990305662|0.7443715
D0|DOJ would have to consult  with HHS before invoking  its injunctive authority.|||-0.964765966|0.9900181
|||||
D1|OUTSTANDING ISSUES HHS is primarily concerned about the overlap in enforcement  authority  that these  new provisions would create.|1||0.992215097|0.9993218
D1|As currently drafted, the only area of facility noncompliance that would not pose the problem of overlapping authority for both agencies would be those cases where violations are minimal  or where the harm to residents is isolated.|1||0.99829179|0.8801407
D1|HHS is concerned  that  in situations  where both agencies have an interest in initiating an enforcement action, DOJ will push HCFA to delay its enforcement action, since DOJ's need  to build a solid case for conviction  may not coincide  with  HCFA's  need to act swiftly when needed.|1||-0.996367216|0.9996476
D1|In addition, HHS is concerned that  DOJ  will develop  its own quality standards for individual facilities and chains when deciding whether to initiate prosecution, thus requiring facilities to comply with one set of standards developed by HCFA  and another  set of standards developed by DOJ.|1||-0.923819065|0.030153768
|||||
D1|DOJ feels that the overlap in enforcement authority is limited to enforcement action in individual facilities.|1||-0.953821361|0.98602664
D1|Currently, no one has the authority to prosecute nursing home chains for repeated violations, which this statute would provide to DOJ.|||-0.985505044|0.000476478
D1|In addition, this policy would not preclude  HHS from taking any action to protect the health and safety of residents, and DOJ is willing to codify this in an MOU.|||0.798555255|0.07883165
|||||
D1|PROPOSED DPC POSITION Modify the DOJ proposal to limit their new enforcement authority to criminal violations and require HHS to propose new legislation providing the111 with new authority to impose civil penalties.|1||-0.987792075|0.9955319
D1|Under this option, the Department of Justice would be allowed to impose new criminal penalties on individuals, facility chains, and management companites who knowingly and willfully engage in a patterns of physical or mental harm to residents.|1||-0.987634182|8.03E-07
D1|HHS would propose new  legislation creating civil penalties that could be imposed on individuals,  facility chains, or management  companies if they engage in conduct that results in a pattern of physical or mental harm to residents.|1||-0.982366145|0.46281874
D1|This compromise provides virtually the same level of enforcement and eliminates the problematic overlap of authority created by the DOJ proposal.|1||0.997765899|0.99878615

D1|DOJ would continue to have civil authority through the False Claims Act, upon referral from HCFA.|||0.624961674|0.120392375

D1|For nursing home chains, we believe DOJ should have civil authority to pursue nursing home chains only upon referral from HCFA or with the explicit approval of HCFA.|1||-0.635421932|0.000816054

D0|On Monday, we (DPC, 0MB and HHS) will brief you on the status of our Medicaid provider tax enforcement plans for New York and other states who may be out of compliance with current law and regulations.|||-0.807508469|0.000955554
D0|As you well know, this issue is extremely controversial.|||-0.856462836|0.99004656
D0|Therefore, it is critically important that we have Administration-wide agreement and understanding on how we will announce our position on outstanding provider taxes and on how we will subsequently negotiate with affected states.|||0.997809947|0.94073045
D0|This memo provides you with background information to help prepare you for the Monday briefing.|||0.793101668|0.74889916
|||||
D0|BACKGROUND Financing scheme.|||0.928803325|0.9691413
D0|During the late 1980s, many states established financing schemes that had the effect of increasing their Federal Medicaid funds without using additional state resources.|||0.721675456|4.05E-08
D0|"Typically, states would raise funds from health care providers (through provider taxes or ""donations""), then pay back those providers through increased Medicaid payments."|||-0.997499287|2.13E-07
D0|Since the Federal government pays at least half of Medicaid payments, the provider taxes or donations would be repaid in large part by Federal matching payments.|||-0.985143721|0.24291323
D0|Using this mechanism, the state was left with a net gain because it only had to repay part of the provider tax or donation it originally received.|||-0.837173998|0.7114066
D0|This led to an unprecedented drain on the Federal Treasury - the major reason why Federal Medicaid costs more than doubled between 1988 and 1992.|||-0.997206151|0.99605536
|||||
D0|The law and regulatory interpretation of the law.|||0.997682571|0.16838835
D0|Because provider taxes and donations were effectively siphoning off potentially billions of dollars from the Federal Treasury, the Congress limited states' use of these schemes in a bill enacted by President Bush in 1991.|||-0.995463073|0.07765935
D0|It is important to note that the subsequent regulatory interpretation of these limits -- the very regulations that we are now planning to enforce -- was negotiated with the states and the National Governors' Association in 1993.|||0.933053255|0.9947878
|||||
D0|States' continued reliance on impermissible provider taxes and our enforcement record.|||-0.99621129|0.3239887
D0|Despite the new law and the regulations, many states continued to use provider taxes that at least appeared to be out of compliance.|||-0.991106451|0.006458292
D0|To date, these possibly impermissible taxes total an estimated $2 to 4 billion and, in the future, will cost billions more.|||-0.989228725|0.9455457
D0|"In response, HCFA issued letters and discussed its concerns about certain taxes with states, but -- for a variety of reasons -- never took any final action (called a ""disallowance"")."|||-0.998898506|0.9391428
D0|Unfortunately, this has meant that a number of states have continued using these taxes, believing that HCFA might never enforce the law, or that if they did, they could seek recourse through the White House or the Congress.|||-0.998333156|0.29629204
D0|(In fact, since we do not have a good track record on enforcement, budget examiners at CBO and in the Administration have already written off Federal revenue raised through these provider taxes;|||-0.999305844|0.93820286
D0|" this is important to know since it means we could waive past ""abuses"" retrospectively and it might not be scored as a cost.)"|||0.987882614|0.97191286
|||||
D0|The New York provision in the balanced budget.|||0.994090617|0.9921638
D0|To ensure that New York would never be vulnerable to Medicaid provider tax enforcement actions, Senator Moynihan and Senator D' Amato successfully added a provision to the Balanced Budget Act to exempt all of its provider taxes (it has dozens), both retrospectively and prospectively, from disallowances.|||0.978643715|0.29677233
D0|Both in writing and orally we repeatedly objected to this provision.|||-0.974136055|0.99026847
D0|Moreover, we provided alternative statutory language that would have addressed about two-thirds (over $ I billion worth) of the problem.|||-0.992608488|0.99995625
D0|As you know, however, the Senators (through their staff) rejected our offer and insisted on their original provisions.|||-0.655545413|0.15151557
|||||
D0|Line-item veto and New York's reaction.|||-0.98314935|0.9974583
D0|In announcing the line-item veto on August 11, we raised concerns about the cost and ramifications of singling out as permissible one state's provider taxes.|||-0.980027497|0.9996482
D0|Although our actions were generally viewed as responsible and defensible by those who know the program and/or who are budget experts, the same clearly cannot be said of New York's political establishment.|||-0.639918745|0.89222544
D0|The Governor's office, the New York Congressional delegation, the Mayor, providers and unions reacted strongly and negatively to the veto.|||-0.965475917|0.004537094
D0|Among a host of complaints, they charged that they were singled out and were never made aware that this provision could be subject to the line item veto.|||-0.998234272|0.9989089
D0|Most recently they have criticized us for our delay in getting back to them and our willingness to support fixes for the other two vetoed provisions without addressing their problem.|||-0.969685972|0.120111
|||||
D1|Review of provider taxes in New York and other states.|||0.732165456|0.001861982
D1|In August, we began a review of the options to address provider taxes in New York and other states.|1||-0.806197524|2.40E-05
D1|At the time, we well knew that this action would force us to finally attempt to move to enforce laws against provider taxes in all 36 states that may be out of compliance.|1||-0.973609328|0.12968099
D1|We also knew that we had to take this position to support our justification for the line-item veto that no individual state be singled out for special treatment.|1||-0.824106872|0.99946123
|||||
D1|Wednesday's actions.|||-0.938465834|0.89622676
D1|We believe that our discussion with New York next Wednesday about their provider tax status necessitates that we concurrently release similar information to every other potentially affected state.|1||-0.998107791|0.3047774
D1|Three types of actions resulting from this comprehensive review will be announced.|1||0.976286292|0.76121414
D1|First, HCFA will clarify its interpretation of the law and correct the regulation affecting one of the largest New York provider taxes.|1||0.858557403|0.21415475
D1|These policy  clarifications will provide relief to JO states, the largest amount (over $1 billion) going to New York.|1||0.600887716|0.22475481
|||||
D1|Second, HCFA will issue letters to 9 other states notifying them that one or several of their taxes may be impermissible.|1||-0.998984277|0.001456184
D1|Two more states, New York and Louisiana, will also receive this news, but it will be in a letter that also provides some good news about other provider taxes in their states.|1||-0.955685973|0.020676713
D1|HCFA will immediately contact these states to begin discussions.|1||-0.692069411|0.003692306
D1|The letters do not contain final decisions nor are they legally binding, however, they tell these states that, without further information, HCFA could conduct an audit.|1||-0.992216349|0.97148055
|||||
D1|Third, HCFA will ask another 17 states for more information on one or more of their provider taxes, to assess if they are permissible.|1||-0.999610245|0.009689364
D1|(Nine other states who are in one of the top two categories will get similar requests.)|1||-0.947169006|0.001155618
D1|For these states, we simply do not have sufficient information to determine the legality of at least some of their taxes.|||-0.999854088|0.88977206
D1|As we discuss this issue with these states, however, we will also make certain they are aware that they may be eligible for waivers that make their taxes permissible and/or that the provision of additional information may well clarify the legality of their taxes.|1||0.896139622|0.9799595
D1|[NOTE: All states affected are listed in the attached document; dollar amounts are not listed because we will not know them until/unless the states are audited.]|||-0.999313116|0.9996847
|||||
D1|Discussions and negotiations.|||0.984167278|0.002180724
D1|The follow up to these letters will be, we hope, immediate discussions between HCFA and the states.|1||0.747932494|0.03847503
D1|Our primary goal is to protect the Federal Treasury prospectively.|1||0.884577096|0.8882552
D1|We may have to trade getting only a fraction of the retrospective disallowed taxes in return for expeditious agreements to prevent future use of impermissible taxes.|1||-0.530817091|0.9999733
D1|However, the Department of Justice, which must approve all settlements, has not yet decided how it will evaluate these settlements.|1||-0.974832237|0.13940753
D1|This information is crucial to HCFA's ability to negotiate with states in good faith.|1||0.998893797|0.00311711
|||||
D1|Implications.|||0.734660149|0.5152948
D1|Very few of the states who receive notices will be pleased.|1||0.687787294|0.941803
D1|For example, although HCFA is relieving approximately two-thirds of New York's past impermissible tax claims (worth over $1 billion), there is still at least $500 million in taxes that HCFA probably cannot consider legal.|1||-0.992421091|0.9999292
D1|"The New York delegation has already put us on notice that nothing less than a ""hold harmless"" solution is acceptable."|1||-0.985247254|0.98519725
D1|They define this as meaning that they want us to waive all current taxes both retrospectively and prospectively; in other words, they want the provisions we line-item vetoed.|1||-0.978382111|0.9996401
|||||
D1|Those states most displeased will be the 10 others receiving letters that say that we believe that one or more of their provider taxes clearly appear to be out of compliance.|1||-0.999618649|0.9931994
D1|They are: Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, and Tennessee.|||-0.502431393|1.26E-10
D1|Governor Carnahan, who met with Jack Lew recently to discuss Medicaid issues, made it clear that he considers his taxes legal and will go to court if necessary.|1||0.986328065|2.11E-05
D1|There is no question that Missouri has the largest problem -  they could owe nearly $1 billion.|||-0.995316267|0.94082654
|||||
D1|Another complication is that we anticipate that many of these states will appeal to you or the President to over-ride these preliminary or subsequent decisions.|1||-0.982418001|0.99916804
D1|Since this is an enforcement action, we all need to be extremely careful about intervening.|1||0.578024507|0.9964439
D1|We must ensure that you and others who might be talking with Governors are well briefed on the issues, arguments and process.|1||0.997174859|0.89591396
|||||
D1|Finally, some states will inevitably seek legislative solutions, like New York's balanced budget provision.|1||0.748491406|0.9767637
D1|While we probably should not encourage this action (for the same reasons that we vetoed the New York provision), we also should not foreclose the possibility that some type of comprehensive legislative clarification could be helpful as we aim to end the practice of illegitimately using provider taxes.|1||-0.998228371|0.99970776
|||||
D1|Roll-out strategy.|||0.979844809|0.9296413
D1|Obviously, our rationale and process for explaining our enforcement actions is crucial.|1||0.995927155|0.9256673
D1|DPC/NEC and OMB are working with HHS and HCFA to ensure that we have an effective roll-out.|1||0.994268179|0.99826896
D1|This will include how we provide information to the Congress, the states, interested providers and unions, experts who will validate our enforcement action and influence elite media coverage, and -- of course -- a carefully orchestrated New York strategy.|1||0.997360647|0.829359
|||||
D1|We will provide more details of the roll-out on Monday.|1||-0.645421147|0.9710367

D0|A. General Trends.|||0.995178938|0.07087232
D0|Three major trends have complicated efforts to stop drug trafficking across the Southwest Border:|||0.792082548|3.44E-05
|||||
D0|Incompatible communications systems.|||-0.999833107|0.003241015
D0|Operational units must be able to communicate with higher headquarters, with other units and with sources of information.|||0.625240326|2.49E-08
D0|Too many of our systems are either operating in isolation or are dependent upon jerry-rigged solutions.|||-0.999643683|0.6001435
|||||
D0|Lack of timely intelligence in the right hands.|||-0.998770297|0.53610593
D0|Separate agencies collecting intelligence often do not share information that may be relevant for another agency.|||-0.995290041|0.002116801
D0|At the same time, agencies are sometimes unable to internally disseminate intelligence within their own organization in time to stop a shipment.|||-0.940957963|5.33E-05
D0|Information must be made available to all involved law enforcement agencies in time to stop shipments of drugs.|||0.994828522|7.99E-06
|||||
D0|Lack of efficient non-intrusive inspection technology to screen cross-border traffic and detect drugs.|||-0.999454319|0.47110653
D0|Currently there are only three truck scanners in place along the border.|||-0.771199882|0.000163562
D0|Traffickers quickly adjust to the construction of such devices, and shift drugs elsewhere.|||-0.898929298|0.000216762
D0|We must develop, test and field technology that can detect drugs while not hindering legitimate commerce.|||0.999326587|0.001929389
|||||
D0|B. Southwest Border drug interdiction failure.|||-0.995695472|0.016682936
D0|Our efforts  to date have  not yielded  the benefits we had hoped for with the exception of marijuana, though early 1998 seizure data are showing improvements:|||-0.977105856|0.976076
|||||
D0|â€¢ In 1997, we inspected 1.09 million of the 3.54 million commercial trucks and railcars that crossed into the US from Mexico.|||0.998589933|0.000172941
D0|In just 6 incidents, cocaine was found within the commercial cargo contained by these trucks and railcars.|||-0.998878181|4.82E-06
|||||
D0|â€¢ Cocaine seizures declined steadily between I994 and 1997.|||-0.99197793|0.00857284
|||||
D0|â€¢ Heroin seizures are down from 1996's record level.|||-0.959796071|0.29406062
|||||
D0|â€¢ Methamphetarnine sizures in 1997 were 36 percent lower than in 1996.|||-0.998840392|0.99710184
|||||
D0|â€¢ Cocaine seizures as a result of investigations in 1997 were about one eighth of what they were in 1994.|||-0.999400616|0.008466656
|||||
D0|â€¢ Cocaine seizures between POEs (not including traffic checkpoints) declined by 90 percent between 1995 and 1997.|||-0.998630822|1.65E-05
|||||
D0|â€¢ Despite resource enhancements at the Southwest border in recent years, approximately 80 percent of the cocaine destined for the United States through Mexico still crosses the border undetected.|||-0.975737214|0.004087128
|||||
D0|These interdiction trends indicate a challenge posed by drug traffickers that is not being adequately met by our drug control system.|||-0.992176235|6.43E-05

D1|Substantive Issues:     â€¢ From DPC's perspective, we are in general agreement with McCaffrey on many aspects of his Southwest border proposal: the need for better border coordination at the ground level: heightened resources for enforcement such as Customs and Border Patrol; improvements to intelligence architecture; and updated drug-detection technology.|1||0.99921155|0.38178456

D0|I. Summary Inadequate dredging of the channels and berthing  areas serving  the Port of  New  York  and New Jersey, and the lack of leadership to solve the problem, have caused several major port companies to announce that they may  relocate their hub operations to Halifax,  Nova Scotia, or to other U.S. ports.|||-0.99984026|2.80E-08
D0|Company decisions are expected in June or July.|||-0.53299886|0.001113288
D0|Fearful of job losses to Canada, the longshoremen have focused pressure to resolve dredging  issues on  Governors Pataki and Whitman.|||0.748467445|0.004037821
D0|Concurrently, concern about disposal of contaminated dredged  material off New Jersey's coast has prompted Governor Whitman to criticize the  Administration's disposal policies as environmentally unsound.|||-0.99600023|0.9686072
D0|Her message has been lauded and reinforced by environmental groups and New Jersey shore communities, but it has further impeded needed dredging.|||-0.618180871|0.005226523

D1|The primary obstacle to full-scale dredging is the lack of acceptable disposal alternatives.|1||-0.96450305|0.44032174
D1|Disposal alternatives are primarily a state responsibility, but  require federal  action.|||-0.574982822|0.90531546
D1|On  May 24, in an agreement with labor leaders, Governor Whitman promised that limited dredging of berthing areas would begin in June.|||-0.673110485|3.38E-05
D1|We understand  that Governor  Whitman  is planning  a press conference on June 6 to announce the start of dredging, but port companies and unions remain highly skeptical.|1||-0.895871758|0.003487306

D1|We also  must  disarm  possible criticism on the environmental issues.|1||0.994601727|0.86523676
