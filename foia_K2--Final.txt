D0|The content taught in U.S. eighth-grade mathematics classrooms is generally at a seventh grade level compared to the 40 other nations in the TIMSS study.|||0.953093112|0.32655147
D0|A recent international comparison of science and math examinations for collegebound students by the AFT shows that our SAT, ACT, and AP exams are much less rigorous than similar exams from other nations.|||-0.90365845|0.9968893
D0|The standards of state assessments vary widely, and many 8th grade mathematics assessments are less rigorous than the NAEP standards.|||-0.960241497|0.9991774
D0|The voluntary national tests will help address this.|||0.910398364|0.000803078

D0|But as Congress continues to debate the Education Bill this fall, it's become very clear that there some who are waging a multi-front war against our public schools.||1|-0.95395577|0.8646446

D0|First, the Senate has passed an amendment that would virtually kill the Department of Education and abolish some of its most successful efforts to expand public school choice, to bring computers to every classroom, to create more safe and drug-free schools.||1|-0.976868391|0.004046565

D1|The education amendment adopted in the Senate by a vote of 51-49 (Domenici voting for) was intended to allow the Labor Committee to fund school vouchers for children who are the victims of crime.|||-0.624665439|0.002535523
D1|It is basically not implementable although it does change budget resolution numbers.|1||-0.999979615|0.9999945
D1|The amendment came in the form of a second degree to the Wellstone amendment (the Republicans wanted to avoid an up or down vote on Well stone).|1||-0.848417819|9.88E-05

D1|The text of the amendment states the intent as described above, and simply strikes Wellstone number changes and inserts an additional (not offset) $2.5 billion in 2000 in budget authority for Function 400, it also adds an additional $2.5 billion in budget aggregates.|||-0.991802394|0.99990916
D1|Outlays are not changed, the discretionary caps are not changed, nor is the Labor Committee reconciled the additional spending.|||-0.996715665|0.9999852
D1|Since the stated intent of the amendment is not binding, the only effect of this amendment is to increase Function 400 education spending (budget authority only) in the year 2000.|||-0.95746243|0.94764537

D1|During the debate, there was a great deal of confusion about the amendment and and many members (including possibly Senator Domenici) apparently thought it was a Sense of the Senate.|||-0.999600232|0.00273162
D1|The education community is concerned that some will represent this as a test vote on vouchers (the Senate has always filibustered vouchers in the past) but I'd chalk it up to confusion and play down the voucher piece of this.|1||-0.968934894|0.9999474

D0|Protecting Kids|||0.987811267|0.022880437
|||||
D1|Background In August the President directed federal departments to identify ways to provide better information to families about products that pose a special risk to children.|||-0.991611838|4.53E-05
D1|Since that time, EPA has been working on a proposal to fulfill this direction.|1||0.96771872|0.02161795
D1|The proposal on the table has two components: first is an Executive Order that would direct federal departments to consider all information about risks to kids when developing environmental health standards, second is principles for toxics labeling legislation.|1||0.829886317|0.374585
|||||
D1|"The Executive Order, the ""Children's Environmental Health Executive Order"" would require departments, when taking regulatory action, to make a finding either that the action protects children or that there is insufficient information to make such a determination."|1||-0.962857246|0.049419645
D1|"In addition, the draft creates a ""Children's Environmental Health Council"" to oversee the implementation of the Executive Order, to coordinate federal research, and, among other duties, to consult with OIRA on regulatory actions that may affect children's environmental health."|1||0.832414508|0.007109413
|||||
D1|The primary conceptual questions about the Executive Order are: which federal actions should be covered; how should federal departments deal with limited information;|1||0.722835481|0.58340526
D1|and whether the Executive Order is consistent with the Administration's position on regulatory reform legislation.|1||-0.73493588|0.013545102
D1|The draft text has been in circulation only a few days, and I expect that new issues will arise based on the text.|1||-0.9998492|0.93936336
D1|(Our next interagency meeting is Tuesday, January 28.)|||-0.605162382|0.000337655
|||||
D1|The second part of the proposal, principles for labeling legislation, would express the Administration's support for a requirement that manufacturers label products with information about special risks to children.|1||0.650206804|0.58946174
D1|"This proposal is modeled on ""Proposition 65"" a ten year old law in California."|1||-0.997777045|0.05051312
D1|The key to the proposal is that it does not add to government regulation of product content, instead it requires manufacturers to test products and label them appropriately.|1||0.771015942|0.9986141
D1|The government's role is limited to identifying which substances are of concern, and perhaps identifying level below which labeling will not be required.|1||-0.81866765|0.93089443
D1|Proponents of this approach argue that labeling will provide families with the tools they need to make choices among products and create a strong incentive for manufacturers to reformulate potentially unsafe products.|1||0.97199887|0.98371845
D1|The proposal would exempt food and drugs.|1||-0.993535399|0.015857963

D1|Federal agencies and White House staff have raised concerns about legislation in this arena.|1||-0.69162488|6.91E-05
D1|There is little solid data regarding the costs and benefits of a national proposal, and the California model has not been rigorously studied.|||-0.999628186|0.37358963
D1|(We lack data on the costs and benefits of the California law partly because companies have been very reluctant to release information about their costs.)|||-0.998009384|0.020720039
D1|In addition, there are difficult trade and small business implications that need to be hammered out.|1||-0.976781666|0.12196291

D1|Status The Executive Order is in draft and could probably be finalized quickly if EPA generates support within the White House for that position.|1||0.803769767|0.72034055
D1|The process of coming to closure quickly could, however, cause us to miss some more subtle issues, and will likely lead us to draft an Order that is narrowly tailored to environmental health, rather than considering an approach that applies to all health-based regulations.|1||-0.990516245|0.9990363

D1|EPA has drafted about a dozen principles to support labeling legislation.|1||0.993882179|0.8632625

D1|(Recall that EPA proposed this concept at an NEC meeting in June and the proposal was tabled.)|1||-0.998300374|0.89149183

D1|"Background A new proposal to create a federal designation ""American Heritage River"" is being discussed in a process convened by CEQ."|1||-0.519966543|0.03783538
D1|The President would announce a commitment to this idea and work some of the details, including an Executive Order, later.|1||0.852989733|0.001333295
D1|Currently CEQ staff is proposing that identification be based primarily on the cultural value of rivers.|1||-0.981657147|0.004391559
D1|The implication of designation is still under discussion, but would include a call for partnerships with the private sector, federal support for local initiatives and federal steps to protect designated waters.|1||0.649554014|0.001611278
D1|Initially departments have raised some concerns: a designation process will create false expectations that we can solve problems in many places;|1||-0.988645434|0.045712765
D1|choosing waters for cultural significance conflicts with targeting environmental money to solve problems;|1||-0.923816144|0.00135912

D1|I am continuing to work with CEQ as they identify ways to accomplish this goal, but I remain concerned that we may not have good solutions by next week.|1||-0.673397362|0.99737823

D1|They envision that further detail would be developed in coming weeks.|1||0.989680111|0.06852398

D1|Recommendation There are thousands of people across the country who are working to restore enjoyment of their local waterways, and who would welcome new tools to achieve their ends.|1||0.987884939|0.000685714
D1|They need incentives to create jobs and revitalize rundown urban waterfronts; small grants to catalyze their work; better processes for participating in federal decisions; more information about environmental threats in their local area; and a federal commitment to work in ways that are consistent with local needs.|1||0.784796476|3.82E-09
D1|We can do this, and we should focus the effort where people really need it--urban waterways.|1||0.995659292|0.9610664

D1|Currently, Nazi war criminals who have  been denaturalized, but flee prior to the issuance of a final order of deportation, may continue to  collect Social Security benefits.|1||-0.979990065|4.29E-07
D1|The Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of  Justice staff have drafted corrective legislation.|1||0.838825464|0.000156766
D1|Such legislation should go forward without delay.|1||0.958068371|0.0843983

D1|While some groups have contended that such legislation could complicate the Government's ability to track down and successfully prosecute Nazi war criminals in this country, I find that contention difficult to accept.|1||-0.999302983|0.007761723
D1|The federal government must pursue denaturalization and deportation against Nazi war criminals without any reference to whether or not they should receive Social Security benefits.|1||-0.996621609|0.002722003

D1|Current Law and Policy â€¢ Current policy is to remove Nazi war criminals from the U.S. and to deny them Social Security benefits.|||0.971061707|0.000733663
D1|There is, however, a loophole under current law.|||0.595849335|0.001787111
|||||
D1|â€¢ Since the 1980's, the law has provided that Social Security benefits must be cut off when a final order of deportation is issued against an individual because that individual engaged in Nazi persecution or genocide.|||-0.990144968|0.003546121
D1|This provision of Social Security law is specifically for Nazi war criminals and provides for an earlier cut off than for other deportees, whose benefits are not cut off until they are actually deported.|||-0.964033425|0.000200107
|||||
D1|â€¢ Of the 31 living Nazi war criminals who were eligible for Social Security benefits and who have left the United States, only 10 have lost benefits because of the Nazi war criminal provision in current Social Security law.|||0.930459499|1.11E-07
D1|SSA found other grounds to cut off benefits to two additional Nazi war criminals, but they could return to the Social Security rolls.|||-0.999104679|0.000509269
|||||
D1|â€¢ As of March 15, 1997, 18 Nazi war criminals (almost 2/3) were being paid Social Security benefits.|||-0.999231458|0.000587974
D1|In addition, I Nazi war criminal was eligible, but was temporarily not in pay status on March 15 because he was suspended based on the erroneous information that a final order of deportation had, in fact, been issued.|||-0.996792495|4.54E-07
|||||
D1|â€¢ These individuals escaped the Nazi war criminal provision in current Social Security law because DOJ did not, or could not, get a final order of deportation.|||0.936894|0.001700191
D1|Some of these individuals fled before DOJ could act.|||-0.877848148|0.001061153
D1|Others left without a final order of deportation after having reached settlement agreements with DOJ's Office of Special Investigations.|||-0.992545426|8.20E-05
|||||
D1|â€¢ The operation of current law results in the U.S. taxpayers subsidizing the retirement of many Nazi war criminals, contrary to the policy that they not receive Social Security benefits.|||-0.954187989|0.04620887
|||||
D1|â€¢ DOJ and SSA have been meeting over a period of several months.|||0.984742045|0.21115844
D1|Both agencies have concluded that the result under current law is inappropriate and that current law concerning receipt of Social Security benefits by Nazi war criminals needs to be strengthened.|1||-0.944772661|0.00798162
D1|The agencies have developed a legislative proposal.|||0.994168162|0.023165677

D1|Proposal  â€¢ DOJ and SSA propose that Social Security benefits be cut off when a federal court denaturalizes someone on the grounds that the person engaged in Nazi persecution.|1||-0.994147897|0.91720957
D1|This is an earlier point in time than under current law.|1||0.919258177|0.020604257
D1|This proposal would cut off benefits of those who leave the U.S. before an order of deportation is issued, as well as those who attempt to stay in the U.S. by fighting an order of deportation.|1||-0.993060708|0.002634637

D0|I held the meeting yesterday with the DOJ, SSA, Neal Sher, former head of DOJ's OSI and representing the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors, and Doug Bloomfield, representing the World Jewish Congress & World Jewish Restitution Organization.|||0.936062455|2.75E-08
D0|Counsel's Office (Dawn), Public Liaison (Jay Footlik) and 0MB (Melinda Haskins & Richard Green) also attended.|||0.894147933|1.80E-09
|||||
D1|In summary, Messrs. Sher and Bloomfield presented a passionate argument that SSA's proposal will hurt prosecutions of Nazi war criminals.|||0.77936095|0.09843201
D1|They want the status quo left alone and for SSA not to introduce its legislative proposal.|||-0.953670502|0.0459384
D1|They presented the argument that I outlined for you earlier: They deeply believe that some judges will act more sympathetically toward old men who were Nazis if they can argue that not only is the government trying to strip them of their citizenship, but the government is also impoverishing them while they are trying to defend their rights during the judicial process.|||-0.9112252|0.33413267
D1|They think that a single bad outcome in a case could have farreaching implications for other cases.|||-0.987274885|0.3398427
D1|They admit that it is impossible to accurately predict what judges may in fact do, but they hold the view with absolute conviction that this will hurt prosecutions.|||0.959196627|0.97921914
|||||
D1|Obviously, everyone in attendance agreed that we shared the objective of not wanting to do anything to compromise prosecutions of Nazis.|1||-0.752261162|0.99694914
D1|"SSA and DOJ explained how they engaged in interagency discussions to reach what they jointly view as a proposal that properly balances SSA's concern about ""subsidizing the retirement of Nazis"" with enforcement concerns."|1||0.927048504|0.2457522
D1|It is important to note that DOJ concedes that there remains some possible enforcement implications, but again, they believe that this proposal is an appropriate balancing of policy objectives.|1||0.986257493|0.99996173
|||||
D1|In my follow-up with the White House attendees at the meeting, we agree that the specific enforcement concern depends on predictions on what judges may or may not do and therefore does not sound fully compelling EXCEPT that it is impossible to ignore who is raising the concern.|1||-0.995386064|0.9969121
D1|These individuals are representatives of those who are the most concerned about and the most effected by this proposal.|1||0.996842623|0.16761641
D1|It gains us very little to close this SSA loophole if taking that action is decried in the strongest possible terms by the victims of those war criminals as undermining their prosecutions.|1||-0.776844501|0.99864095
|||||
D1|And make no mistake, Messrs. Sher and Bloomfield were absolutely clear that they and their organizations would protest vociforously.|1||0.989136934|9.83E-05
D1|They would protest in the media, and they would protest in Congress.|1||-0.6113801|2.72E-05
D1|They would make sure that it is known that the President has introduced legislation that would compromise the prosecutions of Nazis.|1||-0.991875231|0.073860794
|||||
D1|On the other hand, they said that if SSA is criticized for making such payments they would engage in whatever steps were necessary to explain to the public, to Members of Congress, and to the media that SSA's policies were sound and that anyone promoting an alternative view would be hurting prosecutions.|1||-0.993875921|0.98041534
D1|There is already at least one critical article that has appeared (St. Petersburg Times) and SSA has been contacted by a Tampa CBS affiliate for comment.|1||-0.998572588|9.32E-06
D1|I think that we can anticipate other critical pieces, and it may be picked up by the national press.|1||-0.70285517|0.9591376
D1|Cong. Bunning (R-Ky), chair of the Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee has requested information about the St. Petersburg story.|1||-0.71127528|3.35E-06
|||||
D1|Given the foregoing considerations, I think that this is a very difficult issue, but I have to recommend to you that we provide guidance to SSA that the proposal should not go forward|1||-0.998353362|0.99999356
D1|Normally, I would give quite a bit of deference to Justice and SSA for the product of a solid interagency process.|1||-0.955684662|0.9997706
D1|Nobody wants to provide benefits to Nazis, ESPECIALLY when some of their victims who are legal immigrants may face benefit cut-offs, but we cannot ignore the absolute conviction of those who we heard from who represent the victims when they say that the President will hinder the prosecutions of Nazis with this proposal.|1||-0.988630891|0.6327587

D1|BACKGROUND:|||0.848831415|0.7563657
D1|The current law is that SSA benefits must be cut off when a final order of deportation is issued against an individual becuase that individual engaged in Nazi persecution or genocide.|||-0.999026537|0.002169276
D1|The loophole exists, for example, for a Nazi who flees the country without an order of deportation.|||-0.95355922|9.24E-06
D1|Under those circumstances, SSA benefits would continue.|||0.964470208|0.003739211
D1|Of the 31 living Nazi war criminal who were eligible for benefits and who have left the United  States, only 10 have lost benefits because of the Nazi war criminal provision in current Social Security law.|||-0.966971815|1.32E-08
D1|As of March 15, 1997, 18 Nazi war criminals almost (2/3) were being paid Social Security benefits.|||-0.998897195|1.66E-05
D1|SSA found other grounds to cut off benefits to two additional Nazi war criminals, but they could return to the Social Security roles and the pay status of another one is temporarily suspended.|||-0.999058425|6.07E-06
|||||
D1|There is not a drop-dead deadline to drop a legislative proposal.|1||-0.910323143|0.7127241
D1|However, the urgency of deciding  arises because the subcommittee Chairman & staff have been asking SSA as recently as  yesterday where they are on solving the problem of Nazi's getting paid.|1||-0.528637409|0.003810499
D1|SSA has been putting them off saying that they are continuing to work on the issue.|1||-0.555950761|0.6596967
D1|There is a technical mark-up, but this proposal doesn't have to be a technical (in fact it may not be eligible to be a technical).|1||0.794652998|0.99967134
D1|It could be offered later as a stand-alone (or alternatively a member of Congress could offer a bill and we could support that if we chose to) so the 23rd is not magical, but SSA is feeling pressure to get back to the subcommittee Chair fairly promptly.|1||-0.987483859|0.99980444
|||||
D1|Also pressing is a media inquiry from the Tampa CBS affiliate that SSA has also been holding off for awhile.|1||-0.605716169|0.000441767
D1|They want SSA to tell them what it's doing about the problem.|1||-0.998924196|0.023342462
D1|SSA anticipates that this may be the beginnning of a lot of bad press about how it provides money for the retirement of Nazis.|1||-0.999406815|0.9999616
|||||
D1|This is a no-win situation.|1||-0.998823822|0.30300534
D1|We are either going to be criticized for paying retirement to Nazis or we will be criticized because at least several major Jewish organizations will charge us with compromising enforcement.|1||-0.994031012|0.964538
D1|There is going to be critical press whatever the decision is.|1||-0.578154325|0.45551702
D1|The straight policy call is probably that we should be able to rely upon the Department of Justice to determine the appropriate enforcement assessment and what will or won't damage prosecutions.|1||-0.998128116|0.9762999
D1|And DOJ says they have struck the right balance.|1||0.992202759|0.004312034
D1|However, I don't think that the policy determination can be completely divorced from an assessment of the political overlay on this issue.|1||0.950500846|0.9983203

D1|Here's what I've learned so far: Under the law, prisoners are not to be included in households in determining food stamp allotments.|||-0.994572818|0.9893686
D1|"Last year, after GAO reported that this happens too often, Congress passed a law requiring states to establish ""systems to verify and ensure"" that prisoners aren't counted in households."|||-0.998613358|0.019937024
D1|This can include data matching programs with prisons and/or SSA.|||0.866865218|0.26041964

D1|However, SSA won't be ready to share federal data with states by August, because it hasn't worked out all the bugs of such a system.|1||-0.994995356|0.19786529
D1|States can still meet the requirement if SSA isn't ready, for example by matching data with prisons directly.|1||-0.703914225|0.92303944

D1|We met yesterday with Rahm, Gene, Barbara Chow, and SSA on a possible radio address on stopping fraud in benefit payments to prisoners.|1||-0.795859754|3.59E-05
D1|We agreed that there is some potential in announcing that other agencies (USDA, maybe VA and others) will take advantage of SSA's big new database of prisoners to spot prisoners who are getting benefits.|1||-0.997125328|0.4703246
D1|We will work with OMB to survey agencies for programs where this might work.|1||0.677784145|0.11224837

D0|SSA PRISONER SUSPENSION PROGRAM Brief History on Prisoner Provisions|||0.599664032|0.9482191

D0|Social Security Adminstration Since the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program's inception in 1974, SSI  eligibility has been prohibited for individuals who are inmates of public institutions  (including prisons) throughout a calendar month.|||-0.849732161|7.70E-07

D0|In 1980, legislation was first enacted requiring SSA to suspend payment to individuals convicted of a felony entitled to Social Security disability insurance benefits.|||-0.972650409|1.37E-05
D0|This was expanded in 1983 to cover persons entitled to any Social Security benefits.|||-0.516819477|0.039218653
D0|In February 1995, P.L. 103-387 (the independent agency bill) expanded the classes of affected beneficiaries by including individuals convicted of crimes punishable by more than 1 year imprisonment (regardless of actual sentence imposed) and those found not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.|||0.619740903|2.31E-08
|||||
D0|In May of 1996, the President submitted legislation to the Congress that was designed  to give SSA the authority to operate an incentive payment program, through which prison and jail facilities would be paid an incentive for providing information leading to the suspension of SSI benefits to inmates.|||-0.997823|3.28E-05
D0|Under the President's proposal, when a  match of prisoner data against SSI data is made and the Information leads to a subsequent suspension of SSI benefits, the facility would be eligible to receive a payment from SSA of $400 or $200 depending on the timeliness of the report.|||-0.999322772|0.10969285
D0|In August of 1996, Congress adopted the President's proposal as part of P.L. 104-193.|||0.946890831|0.28393853

D1|We found that many prison officials were not aware of the statutory provision requiring the suspension of Social Security and SSI payments to inmates.|||-0.999320388|0.53482157
D1|In addition, there was no formal process for obtaining this Information from the facilities.|||-0.997697294|0.000841287
D1|Many agreements were informal, ad hoc, which made them difficult to administer and control.|||-0.999610484|0.029173361
|||||
D1|Because the facilities were not aware of the requirements, many reported only once or twice a year to SSA, often the Information was Incomplete and reported manually.|||-0.99906224|0.005264217
D1|The prison officials viewed the requirement as another unfunded mandate.|||-0.988240719|0.8552392
D1|Additionally, some correctional institutions are reluctant to enter into agreements with SSA because of the potential cost to them when Incarcerated individuals lose their Medicare or Medicaid eligibility|||-0.937276959|2.18E-05

D1|There were serious limitations in SSA's prisoner suspension program.|||-0.99683702|0.6947689
D1|The internal processes were fragmented and lacked adequate controls and most tasks were manual.|||-0.999940395|0.9595152
D1|This resulted in the inability to stop payments to prisoners in a timely manner.|||-0.995146215|0.9679003
D1|Even when agreements were in place, SSA lacked a method for monitoring the facilities' compliance.|||-0.999732316|0.21553838

D1|Moreover across the Federal govemment, there has been no consistent effort for appropriately suspending payments to incarcerated individuals or data sharing  of prisoner information among agencies.|||-0.993765354|0.9471037
D1|Because of the numerous Federal and State statutes that govern the redisclosure of prisoner information, Federal agencies are hindered from sharing prisoner information.|||-0.998412132|2.59E-05

D0|There needs to be a coordinated effort within the Federal government regarding the sharing of information about incarcerated individuals.|||-0.874034405|0.3876204
D0|This will ensure that all provisions precluding benefits to incarcerated individuals are enforced.|||0.983701169|0.7834881

D0|Over the last two years, the Administration and the Congress have been able to work together to deliver a number of important victories against drugs.||1|0.997077465|0.001671222

D0|â€¢ With Congress' help, we put in place a $195 million Anti-Drug Youth Media Campaign that is producing real progress.||1|0.996340513|0.9938512
D0|Preliminary results from the Campaign's first pilot phase show that 97 percent of the people in these media markets say they have seen our ads.||1|-0.99964726|0.9608865
D0|Eighty percent say that the ads encouraged conversations about drug use.||1|-0.999510884|0.43217376

D0|â€¢ Together, we also succeeded in establishing the Drug-Free Communities Program, which will soon empower community anti-drug groups in countless towns and cities across the nation.||1|0.998494864|9.51E-05
|||||
D0|"â€¢ We have mobilized millions of Americans to fight youth drug abuse through our ''Prevention Through Service Alliance."""||1|0.993753016|0.002252049
|||||
D0|â€¢ On the supply reduction front, we have also achieved real gains, including, for example, a 40 percent reduction in Peruvian cocaine production over the last two years.||1|0.998476207|0.546303
|||||
D0|â€¢ We have improved law enforcement, putting more cops on beats across the nation, establishing new strong measures to combat money laundering, and taking some of the deadliest weapons out of the hands of the dealers, gangs and druglords.||1|0.998234272|0.10677384

D0|This sort of comprehensive approach, embodied in our National Drug Control Strategy, requires the unflinching support of all segments of the American people to succeed.||1|0.995616436|0.96198285
D0|For that very reason, we cannot allow partisanship to unbalance our counter-drug policies.||1|0.759682119|0.9645627
D0|The taint of partisanship would only cause us to lose vital ground in our efforts to reduce drug abuse and its consequences in America down to a historic new low.||1|-0.989993393|0.5142612

D0|The Administration's counter-drug agenda, much of which is reflected in your current thinking, will build upon these successes.||1|0.985800266|0.84676063
D0|It is imperative that we: expand programs to break the cycle of drugs and crime, particularly through increased treatment within the criminal justice system; strengthen prevention efforts, such as the Drug Free Schools Program, that target our nation's young people; reauthorize the Office of National Drug Control Policy; and, sign into law a new juvenile justice bill.||1|0.891028762|4.36E-07
