D0|Marriage Penalties and Bonuses, and Stay-At-Home Parents|||0.995136797|6.83E-05
|||||
D0|Overview|||0.999616742|0.9815099
|||||
D0|â€¢ These are overlapping, but distinct, issues.|||-0.501633108|0.97682774
D0|Marriage penalties and bonuses affect most married couples as well as many currently urunarried individuals.|||-0.871653438|0.000467578
D0|The tax treatment of marriage is a very broad issue.|||-0.993027627|0.83351505
|||||
D0|The concern about the child care costs of stay-at-home parents is a narrower issue of primary concern to couples with young children.|||0.840753078|0.003572522
|||||
D0|â€¢ This memo has three sections: The first describes marriage penalties, why they arise, and provides examples.|||0.985113382|0.6273077
D0|The second describes and analyses options for reducing marriage penalties.|||0.980400324|0.009835882
D0|The third describes and analyses a few additional options specifically aimed at stayÂ­ at-home parents.|||0.808936238|0.15527874
|||||
D0|I. What Are Marriage Penalties?|||-0.973872781|0.15003589
|||||
D0|A couple that owes more income tax by filing a joint return than they would pay if they were unmarried and each filed separate returns has a marriage penalty.|||-0.996610343|0.7286371
|||||
D0|Conversely, a couple that owes less income tax by filing a joint return than they would pay if they were unmarried and each filed separate returns has a marriage bonus.|||0.512634516|0.96910053
|||||
D0|In general, couples with a stay-at-home spouse receive marriage bonuses, whereas twoÂ­ earner couples in which spouses have similar earnings face marriage penalties.|||-0.672950745|1.91E-05
|||||
D0|Why Do Marriage Penalties and Bonuses Arise?|||-0.917161644|0.14091836
|||||
D0|â—¦ Marriage penalties and bonuses generally arise because the standard deduction and rate brackets for joint filers are less than twice the corresponding amounts for single filers.|||-0.896256149|0.9999801
|||||
D0|For couples with children, marriage penalties may arise because a spouse could file as a head of household ifthe couple were not married.|||-0.920281291|1.10E-06
|||||
D0|The head of household standard deduction and rates are more generous than corresponding amounts for single filers.|||0.997289538|0.9998946
|||||
D0|â€¢ Marriage penalties and bonuses also arise because of other tax provisions, such as the EITC, the taxation of Social Security benefits, and the AMT exemption for which the parameters for joint filers are less than twice the corresponding amounts for single filers.|||-0.830246985|0.99971217
|||||
D0|Examples|||0.976599872|0.7738601
|||||
D0|â€¢ Consider four couples, each with $60,000 of earnings (and no other income).|||-0.896519065|0.023284554
D0|Couples A and B have no children, Couples C and D each have one child.|||0.954044819|0.000102535
D0|Couples A and C have two earners, each with $30,000 of earnings.|||-0.511452675|0.014737495
D0|Couples B and D have one earner with $60,000 of earnings.|||-0.985109448|0.040606
|||||
D0|â€¢ The details of the tax computations for these couples are shown in the attachment.|||0.869218946|0.98545814
|||||
D0|â€¢ In summary, here is what the examples show: Two-earner Couples A and C have marriage penalties, whereas one-earner couples B and D have marriage bonuses.|||-0.827447832|0.9316476
D0|The marriage penalties and bonuses for the couples with a child are smaller than for the couples without a child.|||-0.998449087|8.14E-05
D0|However, this would not be true in all circumstances.|||-0.989247501|0.008198008
D0|Having a child reduces Couple C's and D's tax liability significantly relative to Couples A and B, because of the additional exemption for the child, the child credit, and (for Couple C) the child and dependent care tax credit (CDCTC).|||0.996678352|1.74E-09
|||||
D0|How Large Are Aggregate Marriage Penalties and Bonuses?|||-0.984362125|0.24869487
|||||
D0|â€¢ There are approximately $30 billion per year of marriage penalties and $34 billion per year of marriage bonuses according to a recent CBO study.|||-0.564843953|0.99315566
|||||
D0|â€¢ More taxpayers have bonuses than penalties, with marriage boriuses predominating for low income families, and marriage penalties predominating for high income families, especially when there are two high earners.|||0.622712433|0.84449995
|||||
D1|II. Options for Addressing Marriage Penalties|||0.889546633|0.10822661
|||||
D1|Five options for addressing marriage penalties have been discussed: a single filer option, an income splitting option, making joint tax parameters double single parameters, a two-earner deduction, and a targeted two-earner deduction or credit.|1||-0.929770529|0.99843353
|||||
D1|â—¦ Treasury is doing more analytical work on these options.|1||-0.986228108|0.9924661
|||||
D1|Single Filer Option (H.R. 2456 with 2 I 8 cosponsors)|||0.972079396|0.9140018
|||||
D1|â—¦ Under this option, a married couple could continue to file a joint tax return, or could elect to file two separate returns, as if each were an unmarried individual.|||-0.902134418|1.02E-06
|||||
D1|H.R. 2456 would combine separate filing on one tax return form and lessen some of the inherent complexity of separate filing by arbitrarily prorating deductions and by retaining a joint computation of the EITC and other credits.|||-0.950134456|0.9985903
|||||
D1|Each spouse would report their own earnings, but could reallocate their unearned income by shifting assets.|||-0.975517631|0.007569697
|||||
D1|Dependent exemptions would be allocated in proportion to each spouse's share of their total income (AGI).|||-0.876425326|0.2356365
|||||
D1|As the examples illustrate, optional single filing would significantly reduce marriage penalties.|||0.838898718|0.7583226
D1|In the examples marriage bonuses are unaffected, but in some circumstances marriage bonuses would be increased.|||-0.804047704|0.535938
|||||
D1|The examples also illustrate that married couples with identical total incomes and taxes under current law could pay quite different taxes under optional single filing (compare Couples A and B).|||-0.766554058|0.9797586
|||||
D1|This option would-be very expensive, costing roughly $22 billion (in 1999 income levels) per year|||-0.99634403|0.99918264
|||||
D1|This option would provide only limited or even no tax benefit to stay-at-home parents, since each spouse would report their own earned income.|||-0.999316692|0.9315492
|||||
D1|Optional single filing would also substantially increase the burdens of the income tax system.|||0.729610324|0.9997416
D1|Many, if not most, married couples would have to make three, rather than one, tax computation (joint, his, and hers) in order to determine the filing method that results in the least tax liability.|||-0.996914268|0.000323074
|||||
D1|Currently, couples who pool their resources need not keep separate records by spouse.|||-0.72333771|1.28E-06
D1|Under optional separate filing, separate income and deduction records could be necessary and complex rules would be needed to allocate income, deductions, credits and exemptions.|||-0.795669675|0.7672445
|||||
D1|Income Splitting|||0.828450024|0.5181287
|||||
D1|"A number of Republicans who originally supported H.R. 2456 are now advocating an even more costly approach, which would allow single filing combined with ""income splitting."""|||-0.99984777|0.9969265
D1|The motivation for this option is specifically to provide tax benefits to stay-at-home parents.|||-0.883500338|0.062855795
D1|(Senator Ashcroft's proposal includes this provision.)|||0.972718656|0.8833601
D1|Under income splitting, half of a couple's income, including their earnings, would be attributed to each spouse.|||-0.892049313|0.00492681
|||||
D1|As the examples illustrate, this option would allow two-earner couples to compute their tax as if they were single individuals, reducing their marriage penalties, as under the single filing option.|||0.739591777|0.4435401
D1|Some two-earner couples would receive a larger tax cut (and reduction in marriage penalties) under income splitting, however, because both earned and unearned income could be split.|||0.58484441|0.9326375
|||||
D1|â—¦ Income splitting would greatly increase marriage bonuses.|||-0.82705152|0.9902237
|||||
D1|This option would cost roughly $36 billion (in 1999 income levels) per year.|||-0.977630913|0.99912065
|||||
D1|â—¦ Income splitting would add computational complexity to income tax filing, although it would not be as onerous as single filing since income would simply be split irrespective of which spouse earned the income or owned the underlying asset.|||-0.723479807|0.99999905
|||||
D1|Make Joint Tax Parameters Double Single Parameters|||-0.99170506|0.9915503
|||||
D1|Marriage penalties could be substantially reduced by making the standard deduction and rate brackets for joint filers twice the corresponding amounts for single filers.|||-0.890294731|0.99985933
|||||
D1|One approach would be to increase the joint parameters to twice the current single parameters.|||-0.996892393|0.99559194
|||||
D1|As illustrated by the examples, this option is basically equivalent in effect to income splitting, so would be just as expensive ($36 billion per year), and have the same effect on marriage penalties and bonuses.|||-0.952273309|0.9999615
|||||
D1|However, this option would be much simpler than income splitting, since no additional computations would be required.|||-0.944839597|0.9999789
|||||
D1|An alternative approach would be to reduce the single parameters to half the current joint parameters.|||-0.99591583|0.9993279
|||||
D1|This approach would raise revenue by increasing taxes on most single filers, without reducing taxes paid by married couples.|||0.515007615|0.9852136
|||||
D1|The Treasury reform option adopts an intermediate approach to addressing marriage penalties, but also makes several other significant changes to the tax code.|||-0.67518568|0.99059
|||||
D1|Tackling marriage penalties as part of a broader reform package ameliorates the stark tradeoff between two-earner couples and single taxpayers that a low-cost marriage penalty solution along these lines would require.|||0.943247259|0.99805707
|||||
D0|Two-Earner Deduction (H.R. 2593, sponsored by twenty-two mostly Republican Ways and Means Committee members)|||-0.907167315|0.88689184
|||||
D0|This proposal would resurrect the second earner deduction that existed between 1982 and 1986.|||0.86940372|0.032591537
D0|The deduction is for 10 percent of the first $30,000 of the earnings of the spouse with lesser amount of earnings.|||-0.991788208|0.9871394
|||||
D1|As the examples illustrate, this option can reduce marriage penalties significantly.|||0.996252477|0.8068195
|||||
D1|This option can also increase the marriage bonuses of those already receiving marriage bonuses, or change current marriage penalties into marriage bonuses|||0.884983659|0.33725962
|||||
D1|However, this option provides no tax benefits to stay-at-home parents.|||-0.733451962|0.0654472
|||||
D1|â—¦ Our very preliminary revenue estimates are that this proposal would cost approximately $12 billion per year.|||-0.998278379|0.9999969
|||||
D1|A Targeted Two-Earner Deduction or Credit (A less expensive two-earner deduction)|||-0.985770822|0.99985886
|||||
D1|Better targeting of a second earner deduction can be achieved by setting a percentage floor, say, 20 percent, of combined total income (not only earnings) on the second earner deduction.|||-0.994098425|0.998409
D1|A tax deduction or credit could then be provided for some percentage of the amount by which the earnings of the lower-earning spouse exceed 20 percent of the couple's total income.|||-0.991282344|0.9999795
D1|The size of the deduction or credit can be capped, if there is a resource constraint.|||-0.984205425|0.9991117
|||||
D1|"Compared with a simple second earner deduction, very little of the benefits of a targeted deduction or credit are ""wasted"" on those already receiving marriage bonuses."|||-0.955872059|0.99437153
|||||
D1|As with the previous proposal, limited deductions (or credits) address the problem by providing only incomplete relief to those with very large penalties.|||-0.961504877|0.9966552
|||||
D1|One variant we have examined costs roughly $5 billion per year, though this cost could be dialed up or down depending on revenue targets.|1||-0.843103468|0.99999464

D1|Ill. Options for Helping Stay-At-Home Parents|||-0.999041498|0.009939478
|||||
D1|Two options specifically designed to help stay-at-home parents have been discussed: extending the CDCTC to stay-at-home parents, and providing an additional child credit for young children.|||-0.958195329|5.95E-06
D1|Before describing and analyzing these proposals, the President's Budget proposal to expand the child and dependent care tax credit (CDCTC) is described.|||-0.63104564|0.003510375
|||||
D0|President's Proposal to Expand the CDCTC|||0.863524258|0.96334434
|||||
D0|â—¦ Under the President's Budget proposal, the credit rate would be raised to 50 percent for parents with incomes (AGIs) of $30,000 or less.|||-0.994196415|0.99990916
D0|This rate would phase down by one percentage point for each $1,000 of income above $30,000 until it reached 20 percent for parents with over $59,000 of income.|||-0.977542877|0.84636587
|||||
D0|The President's proposal retains the requirement that both parents (the parent, in single-parent households) must work (or attend school or be fully disabled) in order to be eligible for the CDCTC.|||0.615633309|0.000224182
|||||
D0|The President's proposal (including a simplification provision) would cost $5.1 billion over five years.|||0.795161724|0.97579396
|||||
D0|â—¦ Under this proposal, couples with incomes over $59,000 would have the same CDCTC as under current law.|||-0.995078921|0.9990326
|||||
D0|However, because the credit rate is increased for incomes below $59,000, some couples would have larger marriage penalties under the President's proposal than under current law.|||-0.77706182|0.9948933
|||||
D0|The President's proposal provides no tax benefits to stay-at-home parents.|||-0.912962973|0.7566487

D0|Extend the CDCTC to Stay-At-Home Parents|||-0.540385664|0.01763393

D0|â—¦ Senator Chafee has introduced a bill that would deem taxpayers with one or more children under the age of four to have incurred child care expenses of $150 per month ($1,800 per year) for purposes of the CDCTC.|||-0.999354661|0.4246083
|||||
D0|As under the President's proposal, the credit rate would be raised to 50 percent for parents with incomes (AGs) of $30,000 or less.|||-0.883882582|0.95608014
|||||
D0|However, the 50% rate would phase down more slowly under the Chafee proposal, by one percentage point for each $1,500 of income above $30,000, until it completely phased out.|||-0.957192361|0.99766564
|||||
D0|Under the Chafee proposal, couples with a stay-at-home parent could receive a CDCTC.|||-0.855465114|0.16374972
|||||
D0|However, many single parents and two-earner couples with children under the age of four would also benefit from the Senator Chafee's proposal, either because they work but do not pay for child care, or pay for child care but do not claim as much credit as they would be eligible for under the proposal.|||-0.978377759|0.001377112
|||||
D1|o   We have prepared preliminary revenue estimates for two variants of the Chafee proposal.|1||-0.993500054|0.9994885
|||||
D1|Both variants differ from the Chafee proposal in two respects: they would apply to children under age three (rather than age four), and both would deem minimum expenses on a per-child basis (up to two or more children).|||-0.969563603|1.25E-05
|||||
D1|One variant would allow parents of children under the age of three to claim a deemed amount of annual child care expenses of $1,200 ($2,400 for two or more children under age three) plus actual child care expenses, up to the current law limit of $2,400 ($4,800 for two or more eligible children) for purposes of the CDCTC.|||-0.999496818|2.63E-08
|||||
D1|This variant would cost $13.4 billion over five years ($8.5 billion more than the President's Budget proposal).|||-0.692664504|0.9998443
|||||
D1|A second variant would allow parents of children under the age of three to claim a deemed amount of annual child care expense of $1,200 ($2,400 for two or more children under age three), or, if more, actual child care expenses (up to the current law limit of $2,400 ($4,800 for two or more eligible children)) for purpose of the CDCTC.|||-0.999394298|5.41E-08
D1|It would also phase the credit out at $103,500 of AGL|||-0.990334451|0.83591706

D0|SUBJECT:    Agenda for Your Monday Meeting With Chief of Staff Bowles|||0.679997623|0.046337012

D1|Your meeting Monday afternoon with Erskine Bowles is to discuss tax legislative strategy: how  to move forward the Administration's proposals and defeat the Congressional proposals.|1||-0.55249089|0.64792
D1|A suggested agenda for the meeting, listing the key issues, is attached.|1||0.893467307|0.35410652
D1|This memorandum provides brief comments on each of those issues.|1||0.921650648|0.9040705
|||||
D1|1. Congressional proposal to sunset the tax code.|||-0.854156375|0.95980746
D1|Administration strategy options:|||0.905532837|0.9843374
|||||
D1|â€¢ (a) Oppose.|||-0.962060571|0.008568325
D1|The proposal would create great uncertainty, thus likely inhibit business investment until an alternative tax system were enacted, adversely affecting the economy.|1||-0.997693717|0.98543143
|||||
D1|â€¢ (b) Develop an alternative proposal to sunset only upon enactment, without gap, of a replacement tax system that is fair, promotes economic growth, provides the revenue needed to maintain budgetary discipline, and simplifies the tax system for average Americans.|||0.996731639|0.99992085
D1|This will require that the Congress develop a better system than the current one before it can be repealed.|1||-0.881963313|0.99606675
D1|This will allow members who don't think a better system can be adopted by the Congress to vote for sunset.|1||0.639215469|0.9466977
D1|"An alternative approach is to require the sunset proposal to include a number of""poison pills"" (such as retaining home mortgage interest deduction, charitable deduction, etc.), or possibly linking to increase in minimum wage or campaign finance reform."|1||-0.999037981|0.18129595
D1|Both of these approaches will also generate uncertainty (but because a shift in the tax system will be perceived as less likely, the adverse impact on the economy would be less severe).|1||-0.703718722|0.99985564
|||||
D1|â€¢ (c) Develop an alternative proposal for rerum-free filing or other major simplification of the present tax system (apparently House Democrats are exploring such options).|1||0.916319907|0.9856806
D1|A return-free systems raise many administrative problems (such as how to handle twoÂ­ earner couples, how to provide EITC, etc.) and either places additional burden on IRS when it is facing other problems (reorganization, year 2000 problem, etc.) or places additional burden on employers, or both.|||-0.981097102|0.71804225
|||||
D1|2. Our strategy for enactment of our initiatives:|||0.993690848|0.8342558
|||||
D1|â€¢ (a) Micro strategy:  move individual  bills, possibly on one of pending  revenue measures in Senate (Coverdell, technical corrections, line-item veto substitutes, or, less probably, IRS restructuring).|1||-0.780756652|0.99972624
D1|This approach requires Administration acceptance of the (possibly modified) Congressional bill (which is most troublesome in the case of the Coverdell bill which provides tax credits for sending children to private schools) and offers the opportunity for a major Congressional tax bill.|1||-0.948239684|0.9914057
|||||
D1|(b) Budget reconciliaton.|||-0.913865209|0.8582467

|||||
D1|3. Congressional initiatives:|||0.998671174|0.50327224
|||||
D1|â€¢ (a) Marriage penalties.|||-0.916629195|0.000523425
D1|This is a sympathetic issue, but is costly ($29 billion is one measure of penalties) and administratively complex to completely solve, though less costly targeted options providing limited relief can be designed.|1||-0.916188896|0.9999856
|||||
D1|"Tax incentives for ""stay-home moms""."|||-0.880364418|0.24108627
D1|This issue has been raised in response to the Administration's proposal to expand the child and dependent tax credit.|||-0.952692747|0.5861814
D1|"This will bias the tax system even more strongly against working mothers (who need the credit to offset actual out-of-pocket expenses), while defining ""stay-at-home moms"" in an administratively acceptable manner will be very difficult."|1||-0.999753535|0.998713
|||||
D1|â€¢ (b) Estate tax repeal.|||0.871163368|0.008563094
D1|TRA 97 provided significant immediate relief to owners of businesses, but provided a lengthy schedule (through 2006) for an increase in the estate tax deduction from $600,000 to $1 million, which might be accelerated if necessary to retain the estate tax (which is needed as backstop to income tax);|||-0.717112601|0.001231925
|||||
D1|â€¢ (c) Flat Tax or National Sales Tax.|||-0.93343848|0.15521108
D1|These proposals have strong advocates (who greatly overstate resulting benefits of simplicity and economic growth), but as proposed have many problems, including failure to provide adequate revenue and failure to provide adequate transition relief while significantly shifting burden of tax from high-income taxpayers to others.|1||-0.998801589|0.9997372
|||||
D1|â€¢ (d) Cap tax revenues as a fixed percent of GDP.|||0.999019742|0.9947744
D1|This proposal may have superficial appeal, but could set the stage for runaway deficits and an increase in Federal mandates on States and local governments in lieu of Federal programs.|1||-0.974766314|0.9149385
D1|It might best be fought by getting out the correct facts (average tax rates on most families have gone down, actual tax/GDP ratio is much lower than suggested, etc.).|1||-0.981553078|0.9996432
|||||
D1|â€¢ (e) Coverdell.|||0.977106392|0.004050658
D1|This proposal, which provides tax credits to parents for the cost of their children's private elementary and secondary education, could erode support for high quality public education and will disproportionately favor higher-income families, who are far more able to afford private schooling for their children (even with the tax credit).|1||-0.999922037|0.010314856
D1|"To somewhat mask the unfairness, the proposal would also cover ""supplemental educational expenses"", which are ill-defined, will thus generate administrative difficulties, and will do little to reduce the bias in favor of higher-income families."|1||-0.99818486|0.9989297
|||||
D1|â€¢ (f) IRS restructuring.|||-0.966252148|0.6813455
D1|The House bill meets most of our concerns, and is preferable to earlier (Kerrey-Portrnan) versions and to Roth's likely proposals.|1||0.996823072|0.41826633
D1|The only negatives in the House bill concern inadequate personnel flexibilities and burden of proof and accountant-client privilege issues.|1||0.718101144|0.9996125
|||||
D1|â€¢ (g) Deduction for payroll taxes.|||0.845067561|0.35010073
D1|This proposal is very expensive (about $65 billion annually), and would disproportionately benefit high-income ta.xpayers (both because they have adequate ta.xable income against which the deduction may be offset, and because of the higher-tax rate to which the income being shielded would otherwise have been subject).|1||-0.999610007|0.9999962

D1|Process for Enacting the President's Targeted Tax Cuts This Year|||0.996481657|0.9928122
|||||
D1|The process for enacting one or many of the President's targeted tax cuts this year comes down to a question of what the possible tax vehicles are this year.|1||-0.963921726|0.9974765
D1|There are a number of possibilities:|||0.993178964|0.6537273
|||||
D1|1. Reconciliation.|||0.996871531|0.002698979
D1|The Budget Resolution could call for a reconciliation bill.|||-0.98093158|0.91025484
D1|Reconciling any paid-for tax cuts is dangerous because the reconciliation bill could also be used as a vehicle for tax cuts that use up some or all of the surpluses -- although if tax cuts that are not paid for are included,|1||-0.995590687|0.99930143
D1|they should subject this year's Budget Resolution to a 60-vote point-of-order in the Senate.|1||-0.994685173|0.98268557
D1|Nonetheless, to protect against reconciliation becoming a vehicle for big tax cuts, we should consider opposing having any reconciliation bill at all this year.|1||-0.820649147|0.8384351
|||||
D1|2. Tax bills that are already in the Senate.|||-0.730535865|0.39087102
D1|There are several tax bills that have already come over to the Senate from the House.|||-0.993564069|0.015684808
D1|This is important because, of course, a new tax bill cannot originate in the Senate.|1||0.952587903|0.6783256
D1|The bills that have already come over include  technical corrections, the Coverdell bill, and one or two bills that undo the line-item veto of certain tax provisions in the last tax bill.|||-0.872333288|0.99931264

D1|Keep in mind that such a tax bill would  not have the protections ofreconciliation on the floor e.g. non-germane amendments can be added.|1||-0.951701045|0.97364366
D1|This could be helpful in adding provisions we like, but it could be harmful if provisions we don't like are added or if the bill gets bogged down with a lot of controversial amendments.|1||-0.980247796|0.9999993

D1|Chairman Archer may try to move a bill with provisions that reduce revenues as a percentage of GDP.|||-0.985249102|0.9484481

D1|One is an extenders bill.|||0.960734248|0.06002149
D1|This would be a good bill to which to try to attach the President's tax cuts.|1||-0.84141165|0.9938664

D1|Second, if there is a tobacco settlement bill, it will have some tax components -- aside from the payments required of the tobacco companies.|||-0.806207776|0.9525851
D1|For example, the tax treatment of such payments would have clarified in legislation.Â·|||-0.678587437|0.9990232
D1|Thus a tobacco settlement bill could include a tax section to which other tax-related  provisions could  be attached.|||-0.944750607|0.3632958
D1|The tobacco settlement bill-- IF IT MOVES, AND THAT IS A BIG IF --could be an ideal vehicle for targeted tax cuts because we are already advocating using the tobacco settlement to pay for a number of popular spending  initiatives.|1||-0.995075166|0.99998343

D1|This report does not address the political process that makes marijuana  available to  medically needy individuals.|||-0.934062183|0.6946789
D1|And, it doesn't address public policy questions  such as the  distribution of  marijuana.|||-0.999194324|0.0727421

D0|WHITE HOUSE DRUG POLICY OFFICE ISSUES STATEMENT ON INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE'S REPORT ON MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE||1|0.592430353|0.9999896
D0|(202) 395-6618 (Washington, D.C.) -||1|0.996299565|0.27889398
D0|The White House Office of National Drug Policy (ONDCP) issued the following statement today following the release of the Institute of Medicine's report Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base:||1|-0.887898803|1.27E-07
|||||
D0|In January 1997, ONDCP asked the Institute of Medicine to conduct a review of the scientific evidence for assessing the potential health benefits and risks of marijuana and its constituent cannabinoids.||1|-0.975044966|0.000431334
D0|ONDCP believed that an objective and independent evaluation of research regarding the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes was appropriate given the ongoing debate about cannabis and its health effects.||1|0.856341481|0.9150831
|||||
D0|The report released today by the Institute of Medicine represents the most thorough analysis to date of the relevant scientific literature.||1|0.995299041|0.2266853
D0|It summarizes recent advances in molecular and behavioral neuroscience, in particular newly elaborated systems of transmitters, receptors, and antagonists - all illuminating the physiological effects of cannabinoids.||1|0.999746501|0.9628105
D0|The Institute of Medicine has addressed all issues that ONDCP requested be examined, including: the science base and gaps in scientific knowledge regarding use of marijuana for medicinal purposes; scientific information about marijuana's mechanism of action; peer-reviewed literature on the uses of marijuana; and costs associated with various forms of the component chemical compounds in marijuana and other pharmacotherapies for special medical conditions.||1|0.994811296|4.26E-06
D0|We thank the principal investigators, members of the advisory panel, biomedical and social scientists, patients, advocates, report reviewers, and all who supported the Institute of Medicine in developing this comprehensive report.||1|0.991461515|0.06036282
|||||
D0|The report contains six specific recommendations that address: Continued research into the physiological effects of cannabinoids.||1|0.981131315|0.5270129
D0|Clinical trials of cannabinoid drugs for symptom management.||1|0.997159243|0.5259363
D0|Evaluation of psychological effects of cannabinoids in clinical trials.||1|0.974897504|0.95019025
D0|Studies of individual health risks in smoking marijuana.||1|0.981841564|0.003807738
D0|Clinical trials of marijuana use under limited circumstances for medical purposes.||1|-0.651028872|0.055689506
D0|Short-term use of smoked marijuana under strict conditions for patients with debilitating symptoms.||1|0.912799358|0.9655158
D0|These recommendations are supported by the following observations: Scientific data indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoids for pain relief, control of nausea and vomiting, and appetite stimulation.||1|0.977654397|0.86664426
D0|This value would be enhanced by a rapid onset of drug effect.||1|0.878502131|0.9912764
|||||
D0|The psychological effects of cannabinoids are probably important determinants of their potential therapeutic value.||1|0.93278861|0.9982181
D0|They can influence symptoms indirectly, which could create false impressions of the drug effect or be beneficial as a form of adjunctive therapy.||1|-0.909351468|0.6752487
|||||
D0|Numerous studies suggest that marijuana smoke is an important risk factor in the development of respiratory diseases, but the data that could conclusively establish or refute this suspected link have not been collected.||1|-0.996511996|0.000547473
|||||
D0|Because marijuana is a crude THC delivery system that also delivers harmful substances, smoked marijuana generally should not be recommended for medical use.||1|-0.999153495|0.9583087
D0|Nonetheless, marijuana is widely used by certain patient groups, which raises both safety and efficacy issues.||1|0.539468586|0.5261884
|||||
D0|If there is any future for marijuana as medicine, it lies in its isolated components -- the cannabinoids and their synthetic derivatives.||1|-0.549096584|0.9722759
D0|Isolated cannabinoids will provide more reliable effects than crude plant mixtures.||1|0.880400121|0.9999609
D0|Therefore, the purpose of clinical trials of smoked marijuana would not be to develop marijuana as a licensed drug, but such trials could be a first step towards the development of rapid-onset, nonsmoked cannabinoid delivery systems.||1|0.742917001|0.03338839
|||||
D0|ONDCP appreciates the contributions made by the Institute of Medicine to the debate on the medical efficacy and safety of cannabinoids.||1|0.994273961|0.986331
D0|We will carefully study the recommendations and conclusions contained in this report.||1|0.88019973|0.9910759
D0|We will continue to rely on the professional judgement of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and the Surgeon General on all issues related to the medical value of marijuana and its constituent cannabinoids.||1|0.62286973|3.78E-05
D0|"We note the report's conclusion that ""the future of cannabinoid drugs lies not in smoked marijuana, but in chemically-defined drugs that act on the cannabinoid systems that are a natural component of human physiology."""||1|-0.886438131|0.8218549
D0|We look forward to the considered responses from our nation's public health officials to the interim solutions recommended by the report.||1|0.948648989|0.98629665

|||||
D0|What is the scope of the heroin problem?|||-0.981872141|0.32687923
|||||
D0|Although a relatively small percentage of America's illegal drug users use heroin, the debilitating addictive effects of the drug make it one of the major sources of drug-related health, crime, and social costs.|||0.991912484|0.050789285
D0|ONDCP estimates a population of 810,000 chronic heroin users in the United States in 1995.|||-0.913686395|0.026105933
D0|"While the number of new heroin initiates is still relatively low, it is apparent that the availability of high-purity heroin (which can be smoked or snorted as well as injected) has led to an increase in use -- probably because users see smoking and snorting as ""safer"" than shooting up."|||-0.999145031|0.99914634
|||||
D0|What are the impacts of heroin use?|||-0.993174732|0.40829
|||||
D0|Heroin is a toxic substance: The danger of a fatal overdose is more immediate and likely for a heroin user than for users of other common drugs of abuse because of the route of ingestion and common miscalculations of dosage.|||-0.998648107|0.030002488
D0|The National Institute of Drug Abuse has declared that heroin is a powerfully addicting substance producing tolerance, physical dependence, and the clinical state of addiction (defined as compulsive, often truly uncontrollable drug craving, seeking, and use).|||0.995336592|0.14977463
|||||
D0|Heroin use is associated with crime: The need to purchase large amounts of a costly drug inevitably leads to crime.|||-0.993596554|0.003027455
D0|For decades some cities have estimated that over half of all property crime is attributable to heroin use.|||-0.962260962|0.62141985
D0|Twenty percent of all people arrested in Manhattan in 1997 tested positive for opiates.|||-0.980072141|0.083874285
D0|In the same year, 22 percent of all arrestees in Chicago tested positive for opiates.|||-0.987607539|0.07488309
|||||
D0|Heroin use affects public health: There is a strong nexus between heroin use and many lifeÂ­ threatening communicable diseases, including infections such as hepatitis B and C, HIV/AIDS, and endocarditis; as well as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases (especially as they relate to pregnancy outcomes).|||-0.872205198|2.17E-08
|||||
D0|Why is methadone treatment needed?|||-0.869735539|0.51084393
|||||
D0|Heroin addiction is difficult to overcome: The psycho-pharmacological effects of heroin are extremely strong.|||-0.997710824|0.9849107
D0|Heroin users are more likely to be addicted to the drug than users of other drugs.|||-0.991700113|0.000205812
D0|(An ONDCP study of cocaine, crack, and heroin abuse in six cities found that the percentage of heroin users who used heroin for 30 or more consecutive days over a 90 day period was four times greater than the percentage for crack and powder cocaine users).|||-0.96098423|7.64E-08
|||||
D0|Kicking the heroin habit without methadone as a bridge to abstinence is difficult: the same study found that heroin users reporting 30 or more consecutive days of abstinence in a 90 day period tended to be lower than for crack or powder cocaine users.|||-0.995326638|0.30648917
|||||
D0|Why Methadone?|||-0.991538703|0.5967982
|||||
D0|Methadone has been used for the treatment of heroin addiction since the 1960s.|||0.997091174|0.002302762
D0|It is a synthetic agonist agent for opiates.|||-0.835575759|0.945775
D0|"In other words, methadone operates by ""occupying"" the brain receptor sites that are affected by heroin and blocks the craving attendant to addiction."|||-0.990094721|0.002414591
D0|Because withdrawal from methadone is slower than from heroin, it is relatively easy to maintain an addict on methadone without abrupt side effects.|||0.998288572|0.99768865
|||||
D0|Methadone treatment is the most widely used treatment for heroin addiction today.|||0.995619237|0.14657791
D0|It has been studied more than any other drug treatment modality, with uniformly positive results.|||0.999865055|0.9997199
D0|Over 115,000 Americans are able to lead stable lives as a result of methadone treatment.|||0.999054134|0.00354317
D0|Over 900 methadone treatment programs in America provide an invaluable service.|||0.997902989|0.52982473

D0|Some people have criticized methadone.|||-0.613119721|0.6729543
D0|How effective is methadone?|||-0.935062766|0.68967855
|||||
D0|The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has conducted literally dozens of studies which show the effectiveness of methadone treatment.|||0.90532136|0.001191664
D0|The Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study (DATOS), the most recent study by NIDA, found that among participants in outpatient methadone treatment, weekly heroin use decreased 69 percent, cocaine use by 48 percent (many heroin users are polydrug users), illegal activity decreased 52 percent, and full time work increased by 24 percent.|||-0.997948945|1.59E-08
|||||
D0|How much does methadone treatment cost?|||0.596630991|0.88074625
|||||
D0|Methadone treatment, at an average cost of$13 or less per day, is a cost effective alternative to incarceration.|||0.998605549|0.9999312
|||||
D0|Given methadone's effectiveness, why is this new initiative needed?|||0.575968444|0.9066256
|||||
D0|In spite of this proven track record, methadone treatment capacity has not experienced marked growth.|||-0.783317864|0.9720881
D0|Treatment capacity is insufficient to provide most of the 810,000 heroin addicts with methadone treatment or any other effective form of drug abuse treatment.|||-0.999747217|0.7747327
D0|In 1995, the Institute of Medicine identified ten states in which methadone treatment was not available at all: Arkansas, Idaho, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Vermont, and West Virginia.|||-0.999872446|1.74E-09
|||||
D0|Additionally, studies have shown that not all methadone treatment programs are equal;|||-0.968624532|0.39293826
D0|the full benefits of methadone treatment are only obtained within a comprehensive treatment environment, which screens and evaluates patients and assigns them to treatment regimes based upon the nature of each patient's addiction.|||-0.958084226|0.8265351
D0|However, a 1990 GAO report found that policies, goals and practices varied greatly and that not one of the programs studied evaluated the effectiveness of their treatment.|||-0.991926014|0.43562937
D0|The failures of the unsuccessful programs tarnished the entire idea of methadone treatment, rather than spurring efforts to improve the delivery of services.|||-0.998272538|0.8892433
D0|This initiative is designed to ensure uniform effectiveness through new standards for all programs.|||0.995206058|0.5878475
|||||
D0|How will this initiative make methadone treatment more available, more effective, and better controlled?|||-0.961768985|0.7970347

D0|â€¢ Expansion of Treatment Capacity: The President's National Drug Control Strategy calls for an expansion of drug treatment capacity across the board.|||0.995309055|0.81676805
D0|Specifically the Strategy seeks to reduce the gap between need and capacity by 20 percent by 2002 and by 50 percent by 2007.|||0.968596756|0.011962215
D0|For heroin addicts, this means that we must increase treatment capacity to reach all who are prepared to accept effective drug treatment and supervision.|||0.996052265|0.4993599

D0|I. PURPOSE||1|0.998845935|0.5689736
|||||
D0|To launch the largest ever national media campaign to target youth drug use and educate young people and their parents on the dangers of drugs.||1|0.653715253|1.57E-06
|||||
D0|BACKGROUND||1|0.955839932|0.68742913
|||||
D0|At this event, you will launch the national expansion of the historic youth anti-drug media campaign -- which is already underway in 12 pilot cities.||1|0.988202155|0.018930914
D0|This is the largest publicly funded anti-drug campaign, with a total proposed budget of $1 billion over five years and a dollar-for-dollar match from each media outlet airing the ads.||1|-0.883301735|0.9956728
D0|Using the full power of the mass media to change youth attitudes toward drugs, the campaign will ensure that when teens and adults turn on the television, listen to the radio, or surf the Internet, they will get the message that drugs are dangerous, wrong, and can kill you.||1|0.908588588|0.017315293
D0|Children are exposed to many media messages that normalize drugs.||1|-0.993319392|0.008411641
D0|The campaign will utilize modem media and technology to give alternative messages that will compete with these influences.||1|-0.607133448|0.59848076
|||||
D0|By changing attitudes, youth drug use can be reduced.||1|0.868978262|0.001160188
D0|Studies of drug use rates over the last thirty years show that when young people disapprove of drugs and consider them dangerous, youth use rates decline.||1|-0.873208344|0.025030395
D0|Furthermore, we now know that if a child can reach the age of 21 without using drugs, he or she will probably never use them.||1|-0.990753651|0.008336168
|||||
D0|Specifically, you will announce the following:||1|0.753834009|0.2643794
|||||
D0|"        â—¦ A television ""roadblock"" that will air Thursday evening -- where every network will show the same counter-drug ad at 9:00 PM (EST)."||1|-0.999291778|0.000708593
D0|This ad will reach an estimated 85 percent of American television viewers.||1|0.528992712|0.9736206
D0|The roadblock will be supplemented by print ads in the nation's top 100 newspapers and radio ads in the top 100 media markets.||1|-0.99104476|0.031499613
|||||
D0|â—¦ Local media buys to target specific drug problems in certain regions of the country.||1|-0.95304656|0.001721592
D0|All new ads will provide the campaign clearinghouse number (800-288- 7800) that will be staffed 24 hours a day and provide information on drug prevention.||1|-0.999121964|7.33E-05
D0|The campaign's new interactive website for parents and youth (www.projectknow.com.) will also be unveiled at the event.||1|-0.569894195|1.33E-05
|||||
D0|â—¦   The anti-drug media campaign is more than just ads.||1|-0.999775231|0.9989041
D0|It is coupled with publicÂ­ private partnerships that will generate a wide range of coordinated anti-drug activities with schools, civic organizations, community anti-drug coalitions, and others.||1|0.998879135|0.12494917
D0|It also challenges media outlets to match the campaign's efforts -- on a dollar for dollar basis -- with related pro-bona ads or programming time for youth drug prevention.||1|-0.992591739|0.6860656
|||||
D0|You will be addressing audience of 600: including; 300 students ages 11-15 throughout Georgia; parents; local anti-drug advocates; community activists; and Members of Congress.||1|0.988957882|0.000358855
D0|In addition, the event will be carried live to over 150 satellite event sites around the country.||1|0.97779274|9.59E-06

D0|First  of  all, let's begin by  giving Kim and James  another  hand.||1|0.9968279|0.00215998
D0|Didn't they do a good job?||1|-0.998727262|0.65765464
D0|(Applause.)||1|0.997863114|0.96595997
D0|They spoke well for you.||1|0.975467741|0.023702815
|||||
D0|Mr. Speaker, Governor Miller, Mr. Mayor, General McCaffrey, General Reno, Secretary Shalala, I thank you all for your superb efforts in this endeavor.||1|0.987008274|0.9976036
D0|I'd like to say a special word of appreciation to Jim Burke, the President of the Partnership for a Drug Free America.||1|0.964344501|0.5350154
D0|He's not as well-known to most American children as the President or the Speaker or the Governor, but no American has done more to save the children of this country from the horror of drug abuse than Jim Burke.||1|-0.99001652|0.007100938
D0|And we all owe him a very great debt of gratitude.||1|0.993058801|0.3791659
D0|Thank you.||1|0.921120048|0.9742234
D0|(Applause.)||1|0.997863114|0.96595997
|||||
D0|I'd also like to thank the Ad Council, the Community Anti-Drug Coalition, the athletic teams and sports figures that are represented here today, the business groups, the Georgia Attorney General, and Agriculture Commissioner of the other state and municipal and county officials -- and Congress Peter Deutchfrom Florida is here with us today.||1|0.988115191|4.15E-05
D0|I thank all of them for being here.||1|0.98950398|0.7809338
D0|And there are many others who aren't here who are supporting what we are doing together as Americans.||1|0.673735857|0.003099355
|||||
D0|I was interested when we just watched the ads  to  see what  the young people's reaction was to the various ads.||1|0.538362384|0.838174
D0|I was wondering to myself whether the ads that were most effective with me were also the ones that were most effective to you, or whether they were  different.||1|-0.999613941|0.99950707
D0|I say that  to  make the point that the Speaker made so eloquently -- in the end this is about you, what touches you, what you believe, what your convictions are.||1|0.99038738|0.99998486
|||||
D0|We know from the stories that we just heard from James and from Kim, we know from all the available scientific research, that what Governor Miller said is right -- attitudes drive actions.||1|0.911814511|0.8189521
D0|There are lots of other factors.||1|-0.989785135|0.38357335
D0|There are some places where kids are subject to more temptation than others; there are some blocks where there are more drug dealers than others;  all of  us have to  deal  with  that.||1|0.765286624|0.9670342
D0|But we know that the more young people fear drugs, the more they disapprove of them, the less likely they are to use them.||1|-0.968420863|0.30652675
D0|Therefore, kicking America's drug habit requires a dramatic change in attitudes, accompanied and reenforced by a dramatic increase in personal responsibility by all Americans.||1|0.869477093|0.030951865

D0|Parents have the greatest power -- that's what one of the ads showed us.||1|-0.964298725|0.9641797
D0|The ads we saw today are not meant to replace parents' voices, but to  reenforce them.||1|-0.839080811|0.5594661
D0|Ultimately,  the best drug enforcement program, the best drug prevention program is an effective, caring, loving parent sitting down with a child and talking seriously about drugs early.||1|0.998068273|2.18E-05
|||||
D0|Parents have already told us that these ads help to break the ice with their children.||1|0.736084819|4.09E-06
D0|So I ask the  parents of America today, don't wait until your children are using drugs to talk to them about drugs.||1|-0.978995621|0.1287935
D0|Watch the ads together and discuss them, beginning tonight.||1|0.983928323|0.09690066

D0|The entertainment industry can shape attitudes, as anyone who has a teenager can tell you.||1|0.997307777|0.16814043
D0|The media should never glamorize drugs.||1|-0.993227661|0.15152313
D0|I'm pleased that across the  entertainment  industry,  a real effort is now being made to help, with the anti-drug messages on the Wonderful World of Disney, anti-drug chat groups on America Online, even training sessions about youth drug use for screenwriters and producers at Fox -- something I hope we will see for all people who prepare television programs on all networks.||1|0.994122088|0.9502806

D0|Professional athletes can shape attitudes.||1|0.998701692|0.1315498
D0|I thank Major League Soccer, the Florida Marlins, the New York Mets, Atlanta's own Braves for agreeing to air the ads during their home games.||1|0.602612913|2.97E-05
D0|And while one of government's primary responsibilities is to enforce the law -- and we should -- we can also support this change in attitudes.||1|0.989104927|0.2534533

D0|As General  McCaffrey  said,  with  the help  of  the Speaker and people from across the political spectrum, we have aggressively pursued a comprehensive anti-drug strategy.||1|0.987065852|0.35796878
D0|We've put more police on our streets.||1|-0.851894379|0.015256026
D0|We've strengthened our border patrols.||1|0.997266293|0.04624155
D0|We've toughened penalties.||1|-0.991308272|0.9944559
D0|We do more drug testing of prisoners and parolees to break the link between crime and drugs.||1|-0.996067345|0.028284902
D0|We work more with countries where drugs are grown and processed to try to stop the drugs from coming into the United States in the first place.||1|-0.529087007|0.00016882
|||||
D0|But with this ad campaign, in which the public's investment is matched dollar for dollar by private partners, America is mounting a new and sweeping effort to change the attitude of an entire generation of young people.||1|0.872593999|0.9537705
|||||
D0|Already, we've seen an impact in the 12 cities where the ads have run as a pilot project.||1|0.958463967|0.004903413
D0|Calls -- listen to this --in just those 12 cities, calls to local anti-drug coalition hotlines have increased by up to 500 percent.||1|-0.848528326|0.98255265
D0|Calls to our national anti-drug helpline have nearly tripled.||1|-0.95057106|0.7528038
D0|Young people here in Atlanta say that the ads make them realize the serious consequences of using drugs.||1|-0.985041201|0.004336309
D0|In Denver, middle school students think the ads could scare kids out  of  using drugs, to quote one of them.||1|-0.989306152|0.001377984
D0|In Washington, D.C., young people say, to quote one, the ads make them stop and think about what illegal drugs can do.||1|-0.995804906|0.03241183
|||||
D0|Tonight, when these ads run on every national television network, they will reach more than 40 million Americans, including millions and millions of children.||1|-0.860107422|0.00330273
D0|That is  just the beginning.||1|0.90639025|0.19192378
D0|Over the next five years, we'll help to make sure that when young people turn on the television, listen to the radio, read the newspaper, or surf the Web, they get the powerful message that drugs are wrong, illegal, and can kill.||1|0.999610484|0.000396469
|||||
D0|I'm proud to say, as has already been said by General McCaffrey, that this national media campaign was a part of the historical bipartisan balanced budget agreement reached last year with Speaker Gingrich and the other leaders of Congress.||1|0.99390775|0.9999037
D0|And I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for including this in our budget agreement.||1|0.923742771|0.9250178
D0|It shows what we can accomplish when we put progress ahead of partisanship.||1|0.999387741|0.98890567
D0|I will work with the Congress to fund other important programs in our drug control strategy.||1|0.900512874|0.13066168
|||||
D0|All of us -- parents, the media, athletes, business, government -- have an opportunity and an obligation to make a real difference in the  fight  against  drugs.||1|0.99906832|0.406891
D0|But nothing  we do will succeed, as the Speaker said, unless young people also take responsibility for themselves.||1|-0.999422193|0.047796417
|||||
D0|We've heard some personal stories; I'd like to close with two -- one from my family, and one from the job the American people have so generously given me these six years.||1|0.998083115|0.9960951
D0|Let me begin with the job.||1|0.976725936|0.1584054
|||||
D0|I spent a lot of time haranguing, cajoling, trying to persuade, sometimes putting brutal pressure on countries where drugs are grown or processed, or through which drugs pass, trying to get people to stop doing things that send drugs  to us.||1|-0.971121728|0.8806518
D0|And we've had some success.||1|0.994767427|0.002754064
D0|We supported remarkable efforts by the Coast Guard, for example, to cut off drugs before they get to this country.||1|0.962482631|0.14528729
D0|But  we can never  cut  off  the  whole  flow.||1|-0.999111116|0.87651783
D0|And every time I'd do this, some leader of a country where drugs are grown will say: You know, Mr. President, you're right,  we have a lot of poor farmers in our country, and I wish they'd grow something else.||1|-0.999463141|0.5983813
D0|But America has four percent of the  world's people and you're buying almost 50 percent of the world's drugs.||1|-0.827581346|0.78718984
D0|Nobody is making you buy those drugs.||1|0.94951874|0.94969
D0|So you can say whatever you want to us.||1|0.951745212|0.9966556
D0|If  you just  said tomorrow  -- everybody  in America said, we're not going to buy any more drugs, all our farmers would immediately start to grow something legal and good.||1|0.729650736|0.9997309
D0|And that's true.||1|0.998450041|0.001353043
D0|(Applause.)||1|0.997863114|0.96595997

D0|It is true.||1|0.998933017|0.044823155
D0|It doesn't mean we should stop trying to kill the drugs at the border and stop the imports and break the drug gangs.||1|-0.58649683|0.00044684
D0|But it's true.||1|0.998596609|0.01568516
D0|If  every  American young person tomorrow  said, no, thank  you, they  would grow something else.||1|-0.995042205|0.93137926

D0|I'll tell you another story that's fairly well-known, but I want you to think about what it means for families.||1|0.990136743|0.99989724
D0|This young man was brave enough to say that his mother used drugs, and talk about what -- the pain it caused the family.||1|0.993860841|0.003022819
D0|My brother  nearly  died from a cocaine habit.||1|-0.616704822|8.97E-05
D0|And I've asked myself a thousand times, what kind of fool  was I that  I did not know this  was going on.||1|-0.999291301|0.7811438
D0|You know, I got myself  elected President, I'm supposed to know what people are thinking, what's going on in their minds.||1|0.985467076|0.9704804
D0|How did this happen that I didn't see this coming and didn't stop it?||1|-0.994298398|0.49428996

D0|And when it all happened he said -- I said, when did this start?||1|-0.994124234|0.001501335
D0|He said,  well, in high school; I started using marijuana and drinking beer.||1|-0.908778906|9.56E-07

D0|And I thought to myself, what kind of family member was I?||1|-0.911571264|0.027047208
D0|And these things make you do really bad things.||1|-0.996138752|0.5197375
D0|They make you abuse other people.||1|-0.995084941|0.040529646
D0|Most of the people selling drugs on the street are out there  supporting  their  own  habits.||1|-0.513837814|0.019704662
D0|So you take other people, people who are basically good people, and you turn them into animals, because they don't care what they do to anybody else because they've got to get the money if they have to destroy somebody else, so they can keep feeding their own habits.||1|-0.999879003|0.94446087
D0|They destroy  families.||1|-0.994878888|0.000221006

D0|Not any community, any school, any church, any neighborhood.||1|-0.999869943|0.000163584

D0|So the hardest thing in the  world  to  do is to  get people to change their habits, especially if what you're doing feels  good in the  moment.||1|-0.996617138|0.9889557
D0|But it's very important.||1|0.998235822|0.668202
D0|Nothing is so important -- not the laws, not the investments, not anything.||1|0.738356829|0.9948361

D0|When they're 14 or 15 or 16 or 17 or 18, and life  gets more  complicated,  it's real important  that  they carry  with them the message that they have today deep in their  heart.||1|0.998717308|7.35E-05

D0|I look at all these kids with these America's Pride tee-shirts on, and what I want them to do is to go back and somehow reach all those kids that are in their schools that don't wear those tee-shirts.||1|0.99836868|0.9630709

D0|Q. What does today's report say?|||-0.933768272|0.8805378
|||||
D0|A.      Today's report provides an update of the Administration's National Methamphetamine Strategy and make two key findings: (1) that methamphetamine use is down in 8 key cities;|||0.859659195|8.57E-05
D0|and (2) that clandestine lab seizures by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) are up 170% in 1996.|||-0.96996665|1.37E-09
D0|The Justice Department  report  cites 1996 data  which shows that in eight western cities --Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Omaha, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, and San Jose-- methamphetamine use declined between 7 and 52% from 1995 levels.|||-0.99964571|8.20E-09
|||||
D0|Moreover, the report shows that our strategy is being aggresÂ·sively implemented and showing results.|||-0.958322585|0.99692184
D0|We've worked with Congress to strengthen penalties for meth trafficking and established new controls over precursor chemicals used to manufacture meth.|||0.982018828|4.32E-06
D0|U.S. Attorneys -- working with coalitions of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies -- are successfully prosecuting methamphetamine, including lifetime sentences for certain convicted methamphetamine traffickers.|||0.998377562|0.011945087

D0|Q.  What is methamphetamine?|||-0.996620774|0.3778146
D0|Why is it so dangerous?|||-0.997784913|0.41185927
|||||
D0|A.  Methamphetamine is a synthetic stimulant drug that creates extreme aggressiveness among chronic users.|||0.636561453|0.9269072
D0|The violence-prone, irrational, and aggressive behavior associated with methamphetamine usage make it an especially volatile drug.|||-0.997043192|0.5035862
D0|Meth can be snorted, smoked, injected, or ingested orally.|||-0.994031012|0.99999046
D0|The effects of methamphetamine can last anywhere from 4 to 24 hours, while the effect of cocaine is measured in minutes.|||-0.993693352|0.9605829
D0|The crash that occurs with the tapering off of methamphetamine's effects is often potentially psychologically disastrous.|||-0.997391582|0.9990483
|||||
D0|Additionally, clandestine laboratories that manufacture methamphetamine pose an environmental and safety hazard, as toxic wastes are frequently dumped on the ground or into waterways, as well as the enormously high risk of a fire or explosion.|||-0.908331811|4.89E-09
D0|Anyone near a meth manufacturing lab is in drugs potential danger, and cleanup costs, per lab, run into thousands of dollars.|||-0.9997527|3.38E-08
|||||
D0|Q.  How much does methamphetamine cost?|||-0.610666633|0.8556221
|||||
D0|A. A gram of methamphetamine can begin at $50.|||-0.999616742|0.09208907
D0|For comparison purposes, a gram of cocaine costs about $100.|||-0.997468472|0.97998995
D0|"For this reason, meth is often referred to as the ""poor man's cocaine."""|||-0.998855591|0.012244101
|||||
D0|Q.  How serious is the methamphetamine problem?|||-0.997632623|0.3086796
|||||
D0|A. The methamphetamine problem is serious and spreading.|||0.80981046|0.007755896
D0|In recent years, use of the drug has spread from the West to the Midwest.|||0.971264422|2.73E-05
D0|As a result, meth-related emergency room episodes doubled between 1991 and 1994, and the number of meth-related deaths tripled.|||-0.999440491|0.34429443
D0|Seizures of clandestine laboratories and along the Southwest border also increased during this time period.|||-0.968719959|1.18E-07
|||||
D0|More importantly, methamphetamine is a triple killer and extremely dangerous: First, it is a cheap, highly addictive, long-lasting stimulant that often induces violent behavior;|||0.770769954|0.92252225
D0|Second, labs used to manufacture meth present a high risk of fire or explosion, endangering nearby residents;|||-0.99777323|6.68E-08
D0|and third, the toxic wastes produced by meth labs are often dumped on the ground and in waterways, posing an environmental threat to entire communities.|||-0.98007822|2.21E-06
|||||
D0|Q.      Why are you only providing meth data for 9 cities?|||-0.992371082|0.9148617
D0|Is there data on other cities?|||-0.838828981|0.03276118
|||||
D0|A.      The Drug Use Forecasting System collects meth data for 23 cities across the country.|||0.996077597|0.006286196
D0|The methamphetamine use amongst the arrestees tested in the other 14 cities was so low, it was determined to be insignificant.|||-0.999963999|0.9819516
D0|By insignificant, we mean less than one percent.|||-0.999426365|0.9997031

D0|Q.  Doesn't the drop in the numbers for methamphetamine mean that we're just generating hysteria about methamphetamine when the problem is really disappearing?|||-0.996639013|0.99645823

D0|A.      Not at all.|||-0.999724925|0.1742386

D0|Q. If illegal drugs are such a big problem, then why didn't your new anti-gang bill contain new drug provisions?|||-0.989307463|0.6780423
|||||
D0|A. Our juvenile crime bill does contain increased penalties for people who sell drugs to kids and use kids to sell drugs.|||-0.605490327|0.20219076
D0|But we should keep in mind that existing federal drug laws are already pretty tough.|||0.687677741|0.6893738
D0|Trafficking can carry up to  a life sentence.|||-0.985787272|0.000250066

D0|But we also need to do is to make sure that local prosecutors have more resources to go after the gangs that pedal drugs to our kids.|||0.86405009|0.07675251
D0|Our juvenile crime  bill  does that, too.|||0.730701685|0.5502685

D0|A.      I am deeply disturbed by the current trends in teenage drug use.|||0.989072621|0.6308424
D0|General McCaffrey, the Attorney General and I have spent a great deal of time on this issue.|||0.996378005|0.09775905
D0|That's why I've proposed a national media campaign, leveraged with private sector resources, to reach the 68 million kids at risk in this country.|||-0.955668747|0.7387492
|||||
D0|That's also why we need more programs to stop crimes and drug use from happening in the first place.|||-0.807555974|0.6113903
D0|We need a place for young people to go in those hours after school when they are unsupervised.|||0.979447782|0.003129726
D0|If we don't, they may just wind up on a street corner using drugs or getting involved in delinquent or criminal activity.|||-0.993655562|0.4671093
D0|I've asked Congress to provide funds for after-school programs and for programs for at risk youths.|||-0.991295695|0.000414669
D0|so we could keep kids off the streets and out of trouble.|||0.996850431|0.13090649
D0|I was disappointed that the House didn't include these provisions in its juvenile crime bill, but I'm hopeful that we'll be successful in the Senate.|||-0.509846985|0.9934918

D0|Money Laundering|||-0.994278431|0.09954888
|||||
D0|Q:  Could you briefly describe the proposed regulations on money  laundering?|||-0.990498245|0.6682602
|||||
D0|A:  When I learned of the successes of the New York Geographic Targeting Order (GTO) in dramatically reducing the flow of narcotics proceeds to Columbia, I asked the Treasury Department to examine ways to extend the GTO nationally.|||-0.74314481|0.000210062
|||||
D0|Today's regulations are a response to my request.|||0.94090271|0.90732205
D0|There are three proposed rules which will be published today.|||0.948319674|0.5888116
D0|" The most  fundamental  of  these proposals is to register ""money services businesses"" generally,  which includes money transmitters or remitter, money order issuers and sellers, travelers check issuers and sellers, retail currency exchanges, and check cashers."|||-0.920540035|0.006702032
|||||
D0|The second proposed regulation  would  extend  the  suspicious  activity reporting requirements  -  already  in  place  with respect to banks - to money transmitters and issuers, sellers and redeemers of traveler's checks or money orders.|||-0.903794289|0.94331
|||||
D0|The final proposed regulation essentially makes the New York GTO apply nation-wide and on a permanent basis.|||0.897416592|0.9334733
D0|Under the proposed rule, money transmitters would be required to report currency transactions of $750 or more that involve the transmission of funds to any person outside of the United States.|||-0.998838961|0.07875938
D0|The rule also requires the remitters to verify the identity of the person sending the funds.|||-0.973267496|0.014425585
|||||
D0|Q:  When will these proposed regulations become effective?|||-0.972909987|0.8117562
|||||
D0|A:      There will be a 90-day comment period that begins today.|||0.700776458|0.9953242
D0|We will then review the comments and make any appropriate changes to the rules.|||0.578124762|0.9898269
D0|Once that is complete, we will publish the final rule.|||0.879708767|0.016241567
D0|We hope to  do this by January 1, 1998.|||-0.663473547|0.06595383
|||||
D0|Therules regarding suspicious activity reporting and the new $750 reporting threshold will take effect 30 days after the final rules are published.|||-0.998010933|0.15074718
D0|Money services businesses will have 180 days from publication of the final rules to register with FinCEN.|||-0.997849107|5.44E-05
|||||
D0|Q:  What are the current reporting requirements for sending money transmissions outside the U.S.?|||-0.999302268|0.5717055
|||||
D0|A:  Currently, no record has to be kept for any transmission under $3,000.|||-0.709317863|0.57555246
D0|For transmissions of $3,000 or more, the money transmitter must keep a record of the transmission.|||-0.986197412|0.000182057
D0|For transmissions of $10,000 or more, the money transmitter must fill out a Currency Transaction Report or CTR and file it with the IRS.|||-0.99801445|0.028021779
|||||
D0|Q:  Why the $750 threshold?|||-0.988852859|0.96611404
|||||
D0|A:      Our experience with the El Dorado Task Force indicates that most legitimate money transmissions are between $250 and $500, and that most of the abuse by money launderers occurs above this level.|||-0.791941047|0.0208069
D0|Thus, we made the threshold $750 so as to exclude the majority of legitimate businesses from reporting requirements.|||-0.987863302|0.9325898
|||||
D0|Q:  Money transmitters are used primarily by people who do not have bank accounts -the poor and immigrants.|||-0.999071479|0.021398384
D0|Isn't it then discriminatory to have a $750 threshold for transmitters and not banks?|||-0.7384395|0.8424014
|||||
D0|A:      We do not believe the proposed regulations are discriminatory.|||0.876680076|0.9925667
D0|The $750 amount applies to wires purchased in cash that are sent anywhere outside the United States.|||-0.997616887|0.02334727
D0|We did not focus on any particular country or region.|||-0.999915004|0.2311806
|||||
D0|Also, these regulations do not prevent anyone from wiring money anywhere.|||-0.996970296|0.086572684
D0|You can pay cash to send $100,000 to Colombia tomorrow, so long as you fill out a form and provide a photo ID.|||-0.998421788|0.9999409
D0|The proposed rules are designed to stop the abuse of the money transmitter industry by criminals by collecting information, not to prevent legitimate transactions.|||-0.998079896|0.002178838
|||||
D0|Banks are already subject to extensive regulation.|||-0.954652071|0.0645808
D0|Today's proposed rules are intended to deal with a relatively unregulated area of the financial services industry -  the money services businesses.|||-0.516848743|0.7548221
|||||
D0|GENERAL DRUG POLICY QUESTIONS|||-0.586538851|0.9580337

D0|REPORT ON METHAMPHETAMINE ABUSE AND TRAFFICKING IN THE UNITED STATES:   An Update of the National Methamphetamine Strategy|||0.800505519|0.9933541
|||||
D0|I. Introduction.|||0.977900445|0.8258212
D0|The trafficking and abuse of methamphetamine -- a highly destructive, addictive and violence-causing synthetic drug -Â­ continues to be a national problem.|||-0.987370372|0.69289845
D0|" Methamphetamine, also known on the street as ""crank,"" ""ice,"" and ""speed,"" is a dangerous synthetic stimulant that results in an addiction cycle and physiological traumaÂ· similar to that associated with ""crack"" cocaine use."|||-0.993444681|0.011798295
D0|Methamphetamine may be injected, smoked, snorted, or ingested orally, making it increasingly attractive to casual users.|||-0.522352159|0.9999964
|||||
D0|A. Historical Background.|||0.999866605|0.59616745
|||||
D0|Until the early 1990s, methamphetamine was largely associated with motorcycle gangs who supplied users in various parts of the United States.|||-0.941719353|6.27E-10
D0|Available data show that in the last few years, methamphetamine abuse has risen significantly in the West and Southwest portions of the country.|||-0.705871701|7.28E-05
D0|"   The Drug Use Forecasting [""DUF""] statistics (released in July 1996) confirmed that methamphetamine use was highest in western and southwestern locales."|||-0.998006642|8.39E-05
D0|"According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network [""DAWN""], between 1989 and 1995, the estimated number of nationwide emergency-room drug abuse episodes involving methamphetamine doubled, and between 1991 and 1994, the number of methamphetamine deaths nearly tripled."|||-0.998283148|2.54E-07
|||||
D0|The methamphetamine problem has been spreading into the Midwest and eastward into states such as Arkansas, Georgia, and Florida.|||-0.982154369|1.09E-07
D0|"   For example, in 1996, the Drug Enforcement Administration [""DEA""] seized 236 clandestine methamphetamine laboratories in Missouri."|||-0.998779714|4.04E-05
|||||
D0|Well-organized poly-drug organizations with roots in the Mexican communities on both sides of the border have seized control of methamphetamine trafficking, using sophisticated chemical procurement, manufacturing and transportation techniques.|||0.956173539|2.52E-05
D0|The emergence of the Mexican drug trafficking organizations and their extensive involvement in methamphetamine production and distribution has re-defined the nature of the problem in the United States.|||0.99867034|8.83E-07
D0|According to the El Paso Intelligence Center, the amount of methamphetamine seized along the southwest border increased dramatically in recent years -Â­ nearly 100-fold between 1992 and 1994.|||-0.805724084|0.000137638
|||||
D0|Unlike the cocaine business where Mexican traffickers are forced to rely upon their Colombian counterparts as primary suppliers, the Mexican organizations need not depend upon outside sources to manufacture methamphetamine.|||0.957018852|1.59E-08
D0|Once the precursor chemicals are obtained, Mexican organizations control all links of the entire production, transportation, and distribution chains -- and therefore, unfortunately, gain virtually all of the illicit profits.|||-0.973365188|0.00017731
D0|The Mexican organizations that dominate wholesale methamphetamine trafficking are capable of producing unprecedented quantities of high-purity methamphetamine in largeÂ­ scale laboratories.|||0.992172003|0.003016591
|||||
D0|Methamphetamine also poses a unique public health and environmental hazard because of the nature of its manufacturing process.|||-0.738007128|0.78898287
D0|The toxic properties associated with chemicals in and around methamphetamine laboratories introduce special health risks to law enforcement agents and the neighboring public;|||-0.981935918|2.07E-06
D0|the incendiary and explosive nature of these chemicals further adds to the public safety risks.|||-0.668618202|0.68174297
D0|These hazards and challenges warrant special precautions and training.|||-0.766969323|0.00515453
|||||
D0|B. The Administration's Response.|||-0.780528188|0.9734981
|||||
D0|As a result of this growing methamphetamine threat, in February 1996, the Administration organized and coordinated a National Methamphetamine Conference in Arlington, Virginia to raise the public awareness of the increasing problem.|||-0.702368081|1.86E-06
D0|Over 200 representatives from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies nationwide participated in the Conference, and for three days, experts shared their experiences, successes, and setbacks in their fight against methamphetamine.|||0.997846127|4.60E-10
|||||
D0|"In response to the methamphetamine threat, the President released the National Methamphetamine Strategy [the ""Strategy""] in April 1996."|||-0.975986719|0.006113523
D0|The Strategy assesses the methamphetamine threat, identifies the issues, and draws an action plan to avert the spread of methamphetamine, which, if unchecked, would become a national scourge.|||0.989499331|0.08073135
|||||
D0|The Strategy incorporates many of the recommendations from a broad spectrum of the law enforcement community.|||0.993570328|0.7902615
D0|It also recognizes that in order to tackle the methamphetamine and precursor chemicals problem, the Government must adopt a multiÂ­ disciplinary approach, including legislation, law enforcement, training, chemical regulation, international cooperation, environmental protection, education, and treatment.|||0.997505724|6.52E-05
D0|"Therefore, the Strategy called upon the collective wealth of experience and expertise of the Departments of Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Justice, State, Treasury, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of National Drug Control Policy [""ONDCP""], and other noted experts and scholars."|||0.900590539|7.38E-07
|||||
D0|II. The Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996.|||0.957953155|0.50199366
|||||
D0|"Based upon the Administration's initiative and persistence, Congress took an important step when it enacted the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 [the ""Act""), which was signed into law on October 3, 1996."|||0.962394536|0.000195043
D0|The Act includes many elements that had been suggested in the National Methamphetamine Strategy, including increased penalties and regulatory provisions for precursor chemicals.|||-0.510558069|0.041452944
|||||
D1|Specifically, the Act directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for trafficking in methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals to reflect the nature of such offenses, their relative harm to society, and the need for aggressive law enforcement action.|||0.508839548|0.02508672
D1|It also requests that the Commission consider significant penalty enhancements for laboratory operators who mishandle ignitable, corrosive, reactive, and toxic chemicals so as to pose a risk to public safety and the environment.|||-0.868330657|0.9985745
D1|"   The Department of Justice [""DOJ""] is attempting to ensure that the Sentencing Commission's Guidelines, currently in the drafting phase, reflect the legislative intent to increase penalties substantially for methamphetamine offenses."|1||-0.990323424|0.12166483
|||||
D1|The Act includes tighter controls on retail sales of drug products containing key precursor chemicals:  ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine.|||-0.96874845|0.18580678
D1|Because methamphetamine must be synthesized from precursor chemicals, regulatory control of a select group of chemicals can impede clandestine production of the drug.|||-0.99095577|0.001186247
|||||
D0|III. Methamphetamine:   A Top Law Enforcement Priority.|||0.99893707|0.013710715
|||||
D1|The Administration continues to place methamphetamine enforcement efforts as a top priority.|||0.958889306|0.009700278
D1|We must continue our cooperative partnerships among federal, state, and local agencies and organizations.|||0.996791661|0.000947864
D1|There should be continued frank and candid conversations to discuss openly the difficulties faced by each region of the country.|||0.996511161|0.35451362
|||||
D1|In 1996, at the request of the Attorney General, each U.S. Attorney assessed the methamphetamine problem in her/his district and together with the federal, state, and local agencies, came up with a plan to address the problem.|||0.899674296|8.39E-08
D1|In some cases -- particularly, in the Midwest and California -- the U.S. Attorneys developed regional strategies.|||0.993132293|0.87331533
|||||
D1|In addition, law enforcement agencies continue to develop intelligence and information on trafficking organizations and clandestine laboratories to assist in the monitoring of shipments of methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals -- with a special emphasis on major violent methamphetamine trafficking organizations.|||0.990565419|7.20E-10
D1|Based upon this information, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies are selecting and pursuing the highest-level and most dangerous targets.|||0.956514716|2.08E-05
|||||
D1|In addition, the Administration is addressing public safety issues connected with the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine.|||-0.597399056|0.0001564
D1|The environmental dangers presented by manufacturers of methamphetamine and the explosive potentialities pose significant hazards to private citizens and law enforcement personnel.|||-0.946075797|0.00304664
|||||
D0|One sad example of the dangers of methamphetamine production occurred in Perris, California on April 19, 1997, when a fire exploded in a trailer home seriously burning two young children, ages 4 and 6.|||-0.999868751|9.47E-07
D0|The investigators determined that the fire was caused by the mother of the two children attempting to extract pseudoephedrine from certain pharmaceutical tablets.|||-0.999693274|0.000379376
D0|The mother was subsequently arrested on suspicion of manufacturing methamphetamine and four counts of child endangerment, and more than 1,400 bottles of pseudoephedrine were recovered from the scene.|||-0.990850329|1.40E-09
D0|Such dangers must be addressed -- not only by law enforcement authorities -- but also in cooperation with public health and safety officials.|||0.978325605|0.49457136
|||||
D0|A. Drug Enforcement Administration Initiatives.|||0.995895267|0.3579856
|||||
D1|The DEA, in particular, has demonstrated its commitment to combat the spread of methamphetamine trafficking and abuse by undertaking significant law enforcement and educational efforts.|||0.998102844|0.011790102
D1|DEA Clandestine Laboratory Enforcement Teams seized 879 clandestine methamphetamine laboratories -- 2.7 times the number seized (326) in 1995.|||-0.906995177|4.71E-09
D1|Current projections indicate that an even higher number of seizures will be achieved in 1997.|||-0.944659352|0.9985147
|||||
D1|1   The above chart represents the laboratory seizures in which the DEA assisted or participated;|||-0.998395741|0.006705353
D1|it does not, however, account for the numerous law enforcement actions by the state and local authorities.|||-0.98269695|0.001830084
|||||
D0|In addition, DEA's Special Operations Division, since April 1996, has funded or assisted in approximately 80 major methamphetamine investigations of Mexican targets.|||0.997407258|7.46E-08
D0|Many of these investigations involve the use of extensive court-authorized electronic surveillance and other sophisticated investigative techniques.|||0.541456699|0.3685875
|||||
D0|DEA has also provided substantial support to state and local law enforcement agencies in combatting the distribution of methamphetamine on our streets.|||0.998428643|0.001298594
D0|The DEA Domestic Operations Section established a Special Enforcement Program entitled Operation VELOCITY which targets major methamphetamine organizations, as well as independent traffickers in the United States.|||-0.740427077|7.01E-06
|||||
D1|Moreover, the DEA Office of Diversion Control established a priority targeting system named Operation BACKTRACK which targets rogue chemical companies that supply clandestine methamphetamine laboratories.|||-0.990061998|8.13E-05
D1|"  Also, DEA, in conjunction with the California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement [""BNE""), the Western State Intelligence Network, and the El Paso Intelligence Center, continues to work to establish a National Clandestine Laboratory Data Base, which will assist all law enforcement agencies in methamphetamine investigations and provide a national perspective on clandestine laboratories, based upon input from all law enforcement agencies."|||0.996206164|8.87E-09
D1|DEA has formulated plans to purchase new safety equipment, such as air monitors, air purified respirators, laboratory trucks, fire-resistant clothing, and other tactical clothing for DEA agents and state and local officers who raid clandestine laboratories.|||0.965736806|5.24E-07
|||||
D0|B. Successful Prosecutions.|||0.995499909|0.38023138
|||||
D0|United States Attorneys around the nation continue to acknowledge methamphetamine as a growing threat.|||-0.511829197|0.000490174
|||||
D0|There are two primary factors which contribute to the large increase in DEA seizures of methamphetamine laboratories --     (1) the spread eastward of clandestine laboratory activity;|||-0.733375072|3.06E-07
D0|and     (2) the enhanced attention by law enforcement around the country.|||0.99764365|3.19E-05
D0|"The spread eastward of methamphetamine manufacturers can.be attributed, in large part, to the growth of small entrepreneurs using the ""Nazi"" method"" to produce small batches of methamphetamine (four ounces or less)."|||-0.964391708|3.76E-07
D0|Their source of precursor chemicals frequently is pseudoephedrine tablets purchased at local retail outlets;|||-0.994485199|7.13E-07
D0|approximately 680 tablets of pseudoephedrine yield one ounce of finished methamphetamine.|||-0.999633789|0.8173213
D0|methamphetamine cases have been investigated and prosecuted by federal agencies in close coordination and cooperation with the state and local law enforcement agencies, and many others have been prosecuted by local District Attorney's Offices throughout the country.|||0.997195244|8.12E-08
|||||
D0|Indeed, in 1996, a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area was designated by the Administration for a five-state region in the Midwest.|||0.572469771|3.04E-05
