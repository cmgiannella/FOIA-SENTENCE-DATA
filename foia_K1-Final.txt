D0|HHS may want to raise the bucket as part of the technicals discussion Ron wants to have|||-0.806974351|0.99918157
D0|Here's the story: for many months, HHS could only see their way clear to a partial fix of the bucket|||-0.999963641|0.99625933
D0|Just as we were about to give up on this, Clay Shaw wrote a letter saying congressional intent was a 100% fix of the bucket|||-0.991145432|0.9983612
D0|This caused HHS to go back to the drawing board (for months)|||-0.999032021|0.002678491
D0|They now see a way to do a 100% fix, but their legal theory conflicts with OMB counsel's theory, and for the moment it's stuck there.|||-0.998408139|0.053961243
|||||
D1|So HHS wants to throw into the technical mix the possibility that Congress could clarify this issue, and they may raise it at our conference call tomorrow|1||-0.872975826|0.94141614
D1|OMB doesnâ€™t disagree|1||-0.99585259|0.9502966
D1|I don't see any downside, other than if we have to use a chit for it|1||0.975648224|0.99780446
D1|But Haskins is on our side here, so it may not use a chit.|1||0.542380273|0.8450785

D1|This morning I said we'd no longer need the bucket if the budget agreement becomes law|1||-0.940103352|0.9881819
D1|Not exactly so|||-0.996303201|0.78508997
D1|Even with the budget agreement, some legal immigrants -- the elderly non-disabled -- who were in the U.S before the welfare law was enacted will not get Medicaid coverage.|||-0.984418392|0.96071357
D1|States who wish to cover them without vastly expanding their Medicaid programs could do so if the bucket were enacted.|||-0.996322393|0.93377656
|||||
D1|Ken is saying we can't do the bucket by 4/1, because CBO is reestimating the baseline in early/mid April and we donâ€™t want it out before then|1||-0.998618484|0.8829728
D1|We are pressing him on his logic, since the cost of the bucket is already in the budget as a legislative proposal.|1||-0.974612892|0.9937295

D1|Can we do by April 1?|1||-0.989906728|0.3879128

D0|"This e-mail 1) notifies you that the Health Division communicated your guidance to HCFA on the three Medicaid â€œwelfare reform"" issues and 2) outlines HCFA's response to your guidance."|||-0.985101819|0.015198045

D1|1) SSI One-Month Gap -- We communicated to HCFA that the one-month gap policy should be made administratively through an All States Letter to the Medicaid Directors as well|||-0.994848728|0.9997526
D1|HCFA will send over the All States Letter for OMB clearance later this week.|1||-0.992649376|0.55374676
|||||
D1|2) Medically-Needy -- We communicated to HCFA that the medically needy policy should be made administratively through an All States Letter to the Medicaid Directors as opposed to promulgating a regulation|||-0.93266952|0.9998437
D1|HCFA said that they would discuss this option with their Office of General Counsel and notify us if they had any legal concerns|1||-0.980287015|0.001801051
D1|If not, HCFA will send over the All States Letter for OMB clearance|||-0.984633088|0.83060884
D1|HCFA mentioned that they would like to distribute one All States Letter that would include both the medically needy policy and the delay regulation.|1||-0.998756289|0.98902965
|||||
D1|3) Delay Regulation -- We communicated to HCFA that you approved of announcing HCFA's intention to promulgate this regulation, since the NPRM process could delay the impact of qualified aliens losing SSI|||-0.992325425|0.9987233
D1|HCFA wants to send out on All States Letter to the Medicaid Directors announcing this policy and to advise that States could retain Medicaid coverage for SSI recipients in the meantime.|1||-0.931654215|0.5566655
|||||
D1|First, we will schedule a meeting early next week with HCFA, OIRA, and the Health Division to discuss this regulation|||-0.859362602|0.000982261
D1|Second, HCFA will send over the All States Letter for OMB clearance|||-0.996830642|0.16431075
D1|This letter will include both the medically needy policy and the announcement of HCFA's intention to promulgate the delay regulation.|||-0.956888914|0.9752745
|||||
D1|We also noted to HCFA that these policies should be handled administratively with little publicity|||-0.998910427|0.9981925
D1|HCFA agreed|||0.976490498|0.5410584
D1|To ensure a consolidated process, OMB policy officials need to coordinate with other EXOP officials in order to convey that these policies should be handled with minimal publicity.|1||-0.782957017|0.9044557

D1|Latest status: We, especially OMB, are considering whether to do HHS's administrative fix to the bucket|1||0.816095173|0.9998012
D1|It is not the advocatesâ€™ full fix, but a 2-part regulatory fix HHS devised: a temporary delay for everyone, which will help all states with a bucket problem; and a new policy on how states define â€œmedically needyâ€ Medicaid programs, which will permanently help some states with a bucket problem|||-0.932960272|0.97778475
D1|Between the 2 parts, it will fix a decent portion of the bucket, but not all|1||-0.997817874|0.99390703
D1|(I will try to get a sense of how much.)|||-0.751677155|0.776124

D1|Nancy-Ann's first take is that Raines needs to decide whether HCFA must come up with an offset to the $1.9 billion cost|1||-0.941351354|0.9980203
D1|Ken and I have pointed out that we fixed a lot of the bucket in our welfare legistative fix package, in our proposal to exempt the disabled from SSI/Medicaid cuts|1||0.998598516|0.9988123
D1|So theoretically we have already paid for a lot of this, and we're just transferring it from a legislative fix to an administrative fix|1||-0.999816239|0.99652714
D1|OMB is trying to scope out the overlap and numbers as they write a memo to Raines.|1||-0.976836979|0.9707069
|||||
D1|l am assuming we would agree with HHS's approach|1||-0.980871558|0.99997425
D1|I think we exhausted the advocatesâ€™ approach|1||-0.999071717|0.9879913
D1|And it will do good things for people and it's fully or largely paid for|1||0.987127662|0.51567113
D1|I should note that it could take a bit of the steam out of our legal immigrant fix package, since the most compelling cases of legal immigrants in nursing homes would then be temporarily addressed|1||0.709669173|0.8421005
D1|I think the only exception to that would be in states that affirmatively decide not to extend Medicaid to legals, and i'm not sure there are any such states at this time.|1||0.896008968|0.9999385
|||||
D1|Option of total administrative fix off the table, unless COLO)sees something new.|||-0.999125898|0.9980743

D1|- Budget's welfare legislative fix package includes partial fix for the bucket: exempt disabled legal immigrants from SSI cuts|||0.547672212|0.95487106
D1|This leaves out the elderly.|||0.933014452|0.019308092

D1|"- HHS's best admin fix thinking had 2 parts: -across the board 1 year delay; and -""medically needyâ€ reg that will help some states."|||0.680586874|0.07395616
|||||
D1|Neither of these last 2 are in the budget so, if we want to go ahead with them, we can't talk about them Till the budget's beÃ©n out for a while|1||-0.996439517|0.9988864
D1|But we could theoretically tell the groups whe the budge is released that we continue to ponder the question of admin fixes.|1||-0.508960962|0.9819062
|||||
D1|The OMB director has apparently at last opined on the â€œbucketâ€ issue -- i.e., whether there is an administrative way to allow more people losing SSI to keep Medicaid.|1||-0.953353703|0.98350096
|||||
D1|Raines endorsed HHS's partial fix, which we've also been pushing|1||-0.627888322|0.99784076
D1|"(HHS rejected on legal grounds the advocatesâ€™ argument that we could do a total fix, where no one would lose Medicaid as a result of losing SSI.) This partial fix would create a temporary ""bucket"" for everyone losing SSI (for a year, I think)"|1||-0.883524299|0.97744113
D1|And it would beef up what is included in a â€œmedically needyâ€ program in a way that would help a group of states.|1||0.90813899|0.000944972
|||||
D1|The effect of this will be to convert part of our fix package from legislative to administrative|1||0.529262125|0.7182517
D1|It also means health providers will be less interested in our package.|||-0.999788105|0.92705566
|||||
D1|OMB doesn't think we should announce anything in the next week or two, because CBO is doing some baseline reestimate.|1||-0.998691618|0.9999373
|||||
D1|While we have never been certain that this confusing issue could be packaged into some kind of I announcement or event, OMB would apparently oppose making a big deal about this publicly|1||-0.998928607|0.99989486
D1|They are nervous that we'll be criticized|1||-0.929436445|0.044357363
D1|Not sure this makes sense.|1||-0.99935025|0.9928893

D1|This should NOT be announced or alluded to in our legal immigration briefing tomorrow.|1||-0.998169184|0.56681234

D1|There will be a staff level discussion within a few days on whether we should have an Administration bill on Superfund|1||-0.992978036|0.387563
D1|Superfund reauthorization remains a priority for the majority in the Congress, and we will need to decide the Administration strategy soon|1||0.928676248|0.22403838
D1|CEQ is contemplating calling a principal's meeting early next week.|||-0.998801827|0.24540477
|||||
D1|This note is to ask your engagement on the process and to quickly summarize the options for strategy and my recommendation.|1||0.857811391|0.83504736
|||||
D1|With regard to the process, I believe that any principal's meeting on this should be jointly convened mol by CEQ and NEC|1||0.738971531|0.5188523
D1|Economic issues are some of the driving issues here|1||0.853551626|0.14546473
D1|A jointly convened setting to send an important message of balance on this issue|1||0.995793819|0.8180001
D1|I plan to make this argument at the staff level|1||0.992364407|0.9407705
D1|I suggest that you mention this to Gene Sperling.|1||0.993335962|0.98230606
|||||
D1|The strategy options are three:|||0.748966813|0.816559
|||||
D1|A) Prepare Administration principles, but allow agency assistance to both majority and minority staff to improve/prepare their bills|||0.770993471|0.000513559
D1|(There is a republican bill, there is as yet no dem alternative.) [It would need to be absolutely clear that assistance does not guarantee Administration endorsement|1||-0.994468331|0.9999995
D1|EPA is likely to support this view.|1||0.592655301|0.83767974
|||||
D1|B) Prepare a narrow Administration bill|||-0.986159027|0.1142268
D1|This approach would send three key signals: (1) we are serious about reform,|1||-0.851007462|0.9106126
D1|(2) all Departments will have a voice,|1||0.99924916|0.013986947
D1|(3) we will only support moderate changes|1||-0.997618496|0.45191798
D1|CEQ is leaning slightly towards this view.|1||-0.978280306|0.99676573
|||||
D1|C) Prepare a broad Administration bill|||0.895376146|0.3585864
D1|This approach would likely provide the most comfort to DOE and DOD because they will see this as a potentially disciplining process for the other Agencies|1||-0.603170991|0.9905714
D1|DOJ (Lois Schiffer) would vehemently oppose this approach.|1||-0.966198087|0.08390791
|||||
D1|I recommend that we initially support option A|1||-0.963479698|0.95060414
D1|In my view, the key supporting reasons are: 1) An Administration process to come up with a bill will be extremely contentious and will distract from our effectiveness on the Hill|1||-0.88760972|0.358152
D1|2) If we genuinely want a bill we will need to negotiate with the majority and there is no particular advantage to having spent months coming up with our own bill fist|1||-0.999116361|0.99803513
D1|3) Principles that set a high standard, will provide guidance to negotiations and will provide thetorical cover to strengthen our hand in the negotiations.|1||0.999387264|0.16191188
|||||
D1|The key weaknesses in this approach are: 1) Some departments will be unhappy enough to undertake their own discreet Hill efforts|1||-0.982744157|0.9269012
D1|I discount this concern because no matter what we do, departments will let their views be known to the Hill|1||-0.955471277|0.8542377
D1|While this adds a measure of chaos, which will likely create some interagency friction, I don't believe it is particularly damaging to the Administration as a whole|1||-0.630725801|0.9942345
D1|2) We need to get key minority Representatives on board first, some of whom definitely do not want a bill to pass|1||-0.822010815|0.9862169
D1|3) Environmentalists are likely to end up more critical of a bill that passes|1||-0.997456253|0.8969304
D1|4) The Administration could be accused of not exercising leadership on this issue|1||-0.986235201|0.56336594
D1|My response would be that our leadership is in Brownfields and in the Administrative reforms.|1||-0.922191501|0.65996665
|||||
D0|Please let me know if you have concerns about my recommended approach.|||0.502518177|0.99587786

D0|As the President said in his State of the Union address, we can be proud that after decades of finger-pointing and failure, we are now replacing welfare checks with paychecks|||-0.645017147|0.8864952
D0|Welfare caseloads have fallen another 2.4 million in the first 13 months of the new welfare reform law, a decline of 4.3 million, or 30 percent, since President Clinton took office|||-0.999355972|3.13E-06
D0|The Presidentâ€™s 1999 budget will build on this success, providing several targeted new tools to help even more people move from welfare to work, while restoring certain food stamp cuts which had nothing to do with welfare reform.|||0.981486619|0.59831846
|||||
D0|Welfare to Work Housing Vouchers|||0.934807062|0.68954885
D0|The President's FY99 budget will take further steps to promote work and welfare reform through a new $283 million plan to provide 50,000 new housing vouchers to welfare recipients who need housing assistance in order to get or keep a job|||-0.50017029|0.92646974
D0|Families could use these housing vouchers to move closer to a new job, to reduce a long commute, or to secure more stable housing to eliminate emergencies that keep them from getting to work every day on time|||0.824571013|0.36284837
D0|These vouchers, awarded to communities on a competitive basis, will give people on welfare a new tool to make the transition to a job and succeed in the work place|||0.994929969|0.007833235
|||||
D0|Welfare to Work Transportation|||0.975478768|0.005753418
D0|One of the biggest barriers facing people who move from welfare to work -- in cities and in rural areas -- is finding transportation to get to jobs, training programs, and child care centers|||-0.565460443|1.18E-05
D0|Few welfare recipients own cars|||0.835255504|0.01713042
D0|Existing mass transit does not provide adequate links to many suburban jobs at all, or within a reasonable commute time|||-0.996495426|0.000240849
D0|In addition, many entry level jobs require evening or weekend hours that are poorly served by existing transit routes|||-0.553407669|0.000220948
D0|To help welfare recipients and other low income workers get to where the jobs are, President Clinton has proposed a $100 million a year welfare to work transportation plan as part of his ISTEA reauthorization bill|||-0.962357521|2.54E-06
D0|This competitive grant program would assist states and localities in developing flexible transportation alternatives, such as van services.|||0.998688042|0.01993085
|||||
D0|Tax Credits for Employers|||0.952457786|0.8203103
D0|The Presidentâ€™s budget proposal extends two important tax credits for employers for an additional year|||0.650275886|0.9476168
D0|The Welfare to Work Tax Credit, enacted in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, provides a credit equal to 35 percent of the first $10,000 in wages in the first year of employment, and 50 percent of the first $10,000 in wages in the second year, to encourage the hiring and retention of long term welfare recipients|||0.818633974|0.21374232
D0|The budget also extends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which provides a credit of up to $2,400 for the first year of wages for eight groups of job seekers.|||0.981510282|0.22589566
|||||
D0|Food Stamps for Legal Immigrants: The President believes that legal immigrants should have the same opportunity, and bear the same responsibility, as other members of society|||0.929340363|6.76E-05
D0|To that end, the Presidentâ€™s 1999 budget proposes to restore Food Stamp benefits for vulnerable groups of legal immigrants|||-0.621854842|0.000661043
D0|The Presidentâ€™s proposals would provide Food Stamp benefits to 730,000 legal immigrants in 1999 at,a cost of $2.5 billion over 5 years|||0.933569789|0.05057222
D0|Specifically, benefits would be restored for: all families with children, immigrants with disabilities and elderly immigrants age 65 and older who entered the U.S before welfare reform was enacted, on the same basis as the SSI and Medicaid restorations in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act;|||0.981017351|1.31E-07

D0|Although the Budget Resolution is not a binding piece of legislation, it shows bipartisan support for the FVO in the broadest sense, and we believe it should be sufficient to instruct the Administration in its regulatory process and in its communications to the states.||1|0.978350282|0.99993944

D0|In addition to the language in the Budget Resolution, Senators Wellstone (D-MN) and Murray (D-WA) have introduced 8 671, and Representative Roybal-Allard (D-CA) stands poised to introduce similar legislation in the House||1|0.589559138|0.001026113
D0|If the clarification set forth in the Budget Resolution is insufficient to promote proper interpretation by HHS as it promulgates regulations, we are asking for the Administrationâ€™s support for this bill which will clarify Congressional intent about the Family Violence Option and give states clear guidance as they implement their welfare plans.||1|-0.988607883|0.9996092
|||||
D0|In light of the additional research and data about the occurrence of violence in the lives of welfare families, we believe it is essential that the states have all the guidance and support that they need to address this problem and craft workable solutions||1|0.990307093|0.95349556
D0|Currently, many states are hesitant to elect the FVO for fear of economic sanctions||1|-0.626101196|0.67437166
D0|Ifthe imprecise wording of the Family Violence Option in last yearâ€™s welfare bill is the stumbling block to a lucid interpretation of this option, then the answer is this Congressional technical clarification||1|-0.796063602|0.9998884
D0|It is imperative that this Administration, with its reputation as a friend to battered women, step forward and support this clarification||1|0.827865243|0.8427307

D0|Peter D Hart Research Associates has just completed a national voter survey that includes two questions measuring support for extending minimum wage and other workplace legal protections to welfare recipients in workfare programs||1|-0.847654879|0.002332109
D0|The survey was conducted by telephone June 6 through 9 among a representative sample of 800 registered voters who participated in the 1996 elections||1|-0.826025188|1.79E-08
D0|The margin of error on these results is +/-4%.||1|-0.782110691|0.9414361
|||||
D0|Strong voter support for minimum wage coverage||1|0.947463512|0.34652194
D0|The survey results reveal that American voters strongly believe that minimum wage laws and other basic legal workplace protections should apply to those in state workfare programs||1|-0.782398164|0.2655794
D0|The survey question reads as follows:||1|-0.996474922|0.26237503
|||||
D0|AS you May know, Congress passed a law last year requiring able bodied welfare recipients to work in state workfare programs||1|0.580500603|0.98375285
D0|Do you believe that the people who are required to work in these workfare programs should be covered by basic legal protections including the minimum wage law, or do you believe that the states should not have to pay the minimum wage to welfare recipients in workfare pragrams?||1|-0.997316658|0.9898084
|||||
D0|Fully 69% agree that workfare participants should be covered, while just 25% believe that states should not have to pay participants the minimum wage.||1|-0.952705264|0.9810659
|||||
D0|We would note that workfare participants are clearly identified in this question wording (fwice) as still being â€œwelfare recipients.â€ making the strong favorable response that much more impressive (and meaningful)||1|0.970796824|0.9997596
D0|The breadth of support for minimum wage coverage is also striking, including two-thirds of those with incomes over $50,000 (67%), professionals (67%), and white voters (67%)||1|0.613489151|0.48159292
D0|Even college-educated men 71%) and Republican voters (62%) favor minimum wage coverage by large margins.||1|0.657647908|0.97710913
|||||
D0|Wage impact argument for coverage is strong||1|-0.560307384|0.9980076
D0|Votersâ€™ initial suppor for coverage doubtless arises from a fundamental sense of faimess||1|-0.979734719|0.99831855
D0|Since other workers receive this protection, they reason, why shouldn't workfare participants in similar jobs?||1|0.926242113|0.001816418
|||||
D0|The survey tested the appeal of this argument for coverage against a powerful opposition case that focuses on the cost of coverage to taxpayers, and finds the wage impact argument prevails by a decisive two to one margin.||1|0.864030778|0.9959194
D0|However, organized labor has another, less immediately obvious reason for believing that coverage is needed â€” namely, the corrosive effect that sub-minimum-wage workfare programs could have on the jobs and wages of low-wage workers outside of workiare programs||1|-0.851506948|0.92377657
D0|Supporters of paying the minimurn wage to people in warkfare programs say that many employees who currently work at the minimum wage would lose their jobs if workfare participants could be forced to work for less, and also say that exernpting one group of workers from minimum wage protections opens the door to undermining the minimum wage for others (59% agree.)||1|-0.9834342|1.04E-05
|||||
D0|Opponents of paying the minimum wage to people in workfare programs say that the taxpayers would have to support higher welfare budgets if states are forced to pay the minimum wage, and also say that welfare recipients who want better pay should get off welfare and find a job on their own (21% agree.)||1|-0.998331606|0.9727975

D0|Diana got a somewhat mysterious call from Ann Lewisâ€™ office last night inviting us to a meeting which I attended today|||-0.582560122|0.000109598
D0|It turned out to be a small meeting (Ann, Eli Attie, Jen Palmieri) on the Welfare to Work Partnership proposal for a one-year anniversary event.|||-0.899496317|2.47E-05
|||||
D1|They like the idea Eli pitched in his memo to the President to have him go to a city with a significant number of companies pledging to hire welfare recipients|1||0.915724993|0.005618145
D1|However, they expect the President to be on vacation and unavailable on August 22nd|||-0.976896346|0.000161692
D1|Moreover, in order to frame the one year anniversary stories for the press, Ann thinks it's best to do an event 7-10 days before the anniversary anyway|1||-0.981846869|0.029410517
D1|Scheduling recommends either August 14 or 15th and Eli has recommended the following cities: St Louis, Indianapolis, Columbus, and Baltimore|1||0.995264173|4.13E-06
D1|(Second tier choices would be Portland, Denver, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Atlanta)|||-0.943520546|4.42E-07
D1|At first glance, Ann thought St Louis would be the best.|1||-0.579432726|0.000876746
|||||
D1|Nye do the Eli event on the 14th or 15th, perhaps we release a one-year report on the bill at the hite House on the 22nd, as you suggested Bruce|1||-0.957209408|0.7906911
D1|I'll start looking into options ASAP.|1||0.902955294|0.6204949
|||||
D1|I used the opportunity to pitch our other ideas as well|1||0.984967172|0.68601656
D1|Ann suggested that Tuesday would be the best day next week to release the letter from the President to Congress on child support, since it's a down day with no other message currently scheduled|1||-0.973102629|7.07E-06
D1|It's likely that timing will coincide well with the juvenile justice mark up|1||0.980435252|0.6320151
D1|I'll work with DOJ, Treasury, and HHS to coordinate.|||0.988176346|0.49747372
|||||
D1|There was also a 1ot of support for having the President announce the new.caseload numbers (which should show we're down 3 million since Jan '93) which hopefully will be ready around the, first week in July and perhaps combine it with the child care reg lf we don't use that for an immunization event|||-0.998975873|0.02291144
D1|There are a couple of non-message event days before he goes to Spain (July 3, 4) where he could make a brief statement on the new numbers or at the top of another event July 2|1||-0.99927026|1.88E-09
D1|Should we push for a Radio Address? (Since the President will be in Madrid that week, we're likely to be bumped by NSC.) If the numbers aren't ready by the 4th, we could them until he gets back on the July 21st and do something then.|1||-0.998217404|0.64513344
|||||
D1|There was less interest in the DLC conference|1||-0.998503089|0.95779085
D1|DLC had proposed holding a welfare to work conference either in D.C sometime before Aug 22nd or in Philadelphia during the National Conference of State Legislators gathering Aug 6-10th|||-0.972701192|1.22E-05
D1|Communications/scheduling preferred the idea of having the President speak to the NCSL conference by satellite because the travel budget is too tight for him to attend, and because they thought it accomplished more than the DLC conference could|1||-0.985740364|0.7513159
D1|Scheduling has regretted the NCSL request already, but Intergovernmental and Scheduling are supportive of revisiting it as a satellite|1||-0.664868951|0.99978465
D1|DLC still wants the President to lead a roundtable discussion on welfare to work, which I think he would enjoy, so they proposed to Christa perhaps having that panel here at the White House and satellite the President's opening remarks to Philadelphia|1||-0.909967005|0.8126022
D1|What doâ€˜you think? We could develop this idea further for the weekly to get some direction from POTUS.|1||-0.981719315|0.9975495
|||||
D1|Thus, this schedule could look something like: June 24th - child support release July 2-4th - release new caseload numbers Aug 6-7th - welfare to work roundtable - DLC and/or NCSL Aug 14-15th - Welfare to Work Partnership event in city with companies Aug 22nd - release some kind of report on the actual anniversary|||-0.856614411|0.8727553

D0|Let me say, finally, that there are a few other things that I think we have to do beyond these three issues of finishing the work of the budget, investing in our people, and expanding trade||1|0.867308676|0.97754776
D0|This moment of prosperity and stability has given us an opportunity to work together to repair our social fabric, to join together to face those issues which, if we don't face them, could flare into crises and keep us from becoming the nation we ought to be in the new century.||1|0.999662519|0.22560896
|||||
D0|And let me just mention a few||1|0.935111463|0.19690944
D0|You were kind enough to mention the Summit of Service that President Bush, President Carter, Mrs Reagan, and General Powell and I and others sponsored in Philadelphia||1|0.979529679|0.86278325
D0|One of the things we have to do if we want to give our children a better future is to help their parents be gainfully employed||1|0.944167376|0.42211953
D0|We were able to reduce the welfare roils dramatically because of a growing economy and because of work we did with states before the passage of the welfare reform bill to help them move people from welfare to work.||1|0.993965805|0.03850009
|||||
D0|Now, this welfare reform bill did two things||1|0.864706278|0.015505992
D0|It required people on welfare who are able-bodied to move from welfare to work within a certain amount of time, and it gave the states in a block grant funds that used to be spent in a federal entitlement so that they would have more flexibility to create incentives for people to move from welfare to work.||1|-0.985034525|0.988171
|||||
D0|Forty of our states now have a windfall there because they're getting money based on how much they got when the welfare rolls were at their peak, and there has been a 20 percent-plus drop in the welfare rolls in the last three years.||1|-0.961020648|0.9949562
|||||
D0|I urge you, in all the states that you're working in, to get the governors, to get the legi ith the business community to spend that money in ways that, with your efforts, can move a million more people from welfare to work in the next four years||1|0.879921198|0.94937
D0|We moved a million people in the last four when we were creating 12 million jobs -- that had never been done before, the 12 million jobs||1|0.989281178|0.017524289
D0|Neither had the million people.||1|-0.998261988|0.008306849

D0|Under the terms of this welfare reform law, whether we create 12 million jobs or not in the private sector, we have to move nearly another million people||1|-0.923962653|0.8298142
D0|We have got to have your help, But the states have the power to do things like give employers the welfare check for a year or two to use as an employment and training subsidy for people that are especially hard to place; to spend even more money on child care; to spend money on education and training.||1|-0.998465776|0.01970783
|||||
D0|So I implore you to help us do this||1|-0.662622154|0.9324536
D0|It will be a terrible thing if, having called for welfare reform and personal responsibility, the end of it is to wind up hurting poor people||1|-0.999958634|0.938455
D0|That was never what was intended||1|-0.99960357|0.068440825

|||||
D0|The second thing I'd like to say is, we have to -- now having faced the structural budget deficit in the country -- we have to deal with the generational deficit||1|0.722471356|0.99994624
D0|That means we have to have long-term entitlement reform to face the realities of the baby boom generation retiring||1|0.538366854|0.8902336
D0|And it will be -- as soon as we get the budget out of the way, I'll be working with the bipartisan leadership in Congress on an approach to that, and I ask for your support.||1|0.945214987|0.99099684
|||||
D0|It also means that we have to fulfill the mission of the Philadelphia summit, with the public and the private sectors doing their jobs||1|0.993147194|0.008760746
D0|Remember what the Philadelphia Summit was about: every child ought to have a safe place to grow up, decent health care, a good education and marketable skills, a mentor and the chance to serve.||1|0.996262848|0.024566619
|||||
D0|And we live in a country where 11 percent of the prople over 65 are poor, but 20 percent-plus of the people under 18 are||1|0.583039403|0.014354115
D0|And we cannot do well unless we do better by our children||1|-0.999827206|0.073977366

D0|We can begin working on a site for the event, and contacting speakers, as soon as the President's schedulers finalize a date.||1|0.798049212|0.00021181

D0|Sponsors: Progressive Policy Institute, The Welfare to Work Foundation, and a conservative think tank (possibly American Enterprise Instilute or the Progress Freedom Foundation)||1|0.821802735|0.002235415
D0|Strategic Objective: Refocus the debate from the Washington argument over whether the welfare bill should have been signed, to the crilical decisions being made right now by slates thal will delermine whether we create an employment system for welfare recipients||1|0.991816819|0.9996014
D0|This is a significant moment for slates and others engaged in developing new policy that should focus on welfare-to-work initiatives||1|0.976820052|0.96333385
D0|"Although 47 states have submitted state plans under the new welfare law, most of the plans are ""placeholders"""||1|-0.994202197|0.3908493
D0|Yet, this is the moment when states should be focused on ercating the new system that moves people from weltare to work||1|-0.620133162|0.8925727
D0|While the economy is strong, and states have new resources tor investment, states should be creating the system of intermediaries and other supports that have been proven to help people get and keep jobs||1|-0.882823646|0.000177554
D0|States will either focus on creating the employment system now, or be derailed in the effort by bureaucratic inertia||1|-0.997339785|0.9417706
D0|So far, there is very little evidence that states have focused on ereating an employment system by cngaging the private and non-profit sectors, and changing the culture of the public sector||1|-0.998519957|0.8912462
D0|Thus, there is a compelling need for Presidential leadership to refocus states and influential thought-leaders on the public policy needed to ereate the bridge to work.||1|0.960656703|0.8049205

D0|Premise: Finishing the job of creating an employment system out of the old welfare programs requires three steps||1|-0.7651003|0.95824903
D0|"First, we need to create the labor market bridge tor entry level workers -- a public/private system of readiness training placement, and retention services for some workers, unsubsidized employment will not be an option al first -- for these participants a communily service opportunity will be necessary to meet the ""work-first"" requirements"||1|0.580037534|5.79E-06
D0|Second, we must make work pay by ercating a scamless employment system tor all low wage workers (not just current and former welfare recipients): child care, health care etc||1|-0.989610791|0.066444606
D0|Finally, we need to measure our progress with the right standards: success means inercased independence through work, and deercased poverty||1|0.980472505|0.004058742
D0|We must be able to identity the successful program components so they can be replicated and through monitoring, we can adjust the programs when necessary.||1|0.997928619|0.58476824

D1|RADIO ADDRESS You will announce that we are sending our America Reads legislation to the Hill, and use that opportunity to emphasize AmeriCorpsâ€™ role in America Reads|||0.645161986|0.9962064
D1|You can also talk about your vision of the Summit and highlight America Reads as a great example of meeting the Summitâ€™s challenge on volunteering, tutoring, and literacy|1||0.866795242|0.97000736
D1|In addition, you can announce that Federal agencies are making a â€œcommitmentâ€ to the Summit that they will expand the number of schools that they have adopted or established partnerships with from approximately 1,500 schools to 2,000 schools by the year 2000|1||0.912953436|0.000318566

D0|MONDAY SPEECH AT SUMMIT When you laid out your original vision of national service back in 1992, you set forth two fundamental principles that captured the public imagination: first, that all young Americans willing to give something back should have the chance to get help for college; and second, that we should challenge those young people to help solve our toughest problems, â€œas teachers, police officers, child care workers -- doing work our country desperately needs,â€ as you said in the first Georgetown speech.|||0.99962914|0.7547321
|||||
D0|AmeriCorps, though still a well-kept secret, has gone a long way toward realizing your overall ideal of citizen service|||0.995969176|0.08592209
D0|But for budgetary and partisan political reasons, it will not become universal anytime soon, and because of its decentralized structure, AmeriCorps has not succeeded in marshaling a nation-wide effort to target a compelling national problem like education or crime.|||-0.998422146|0.9979231
|||||
D1|Your speech in Philadelphia is a chance to breathe new life into that original ideal|1||0.997929811|0.888977
D1|We canâ€™t escape the budgetary constraints, but we can give more young people an incentive to serve, and most important, we can set forth a clear national mission of the problems we need them to solve.|1||0.998356998|0.98625654
|||||
D0|The following proposal are designed with that in mind|||0.786064625|0.08823178
D0|1 Interest-free Year of Service As you know, Rev Tony Campolo has urged you to make it easier for college students and recent graduates to take a year off for service|||0.935617208|0.5548034
D0|Thanks to your income-contingent loan program and to earlier changes allowing loan deferments for service, students can already take advantage of reduced loan payments if they take low-paying service jobs, and can take time off for service without having to begin repayment of their loans|||0.939327538|9.00E-08
D0|Your FY98 budget also includes a proposal to encourage service by no longer treating loan forgiveness as taxable income, so that students who universities forgive their loans will no longer have to pay taxes on it.|||0.502908587|0.99973136
|||||
D1|The only remaining barrier is the interest that accumulates on unsubsidized loans during the period of service|||-0.610061586|0.39114034
D1|The cost of having the Federal government pay that interest is minimal -- $7 million over 5 years|||-0.790720046|0.9991264
D1|This is an inexpensive proposal, and the typical benefit is not enormous, but it would make this policy universal, and it would allow any young person to take time off to serve without increasing his or her debt burden|1||0.988334656|0.995497
D1|The Education Department has expressed some concerns about this.|1||-0.940356195|0.07853024
|||||
D1|2 Police Corps  You can announce $20 million in grants to 17 states for the Police Corps program|1||0.993314445|3.92E-05
D1|The Police Corps was created in your 1994 Crime Bill to increase the number of community police officers with advanced education and training, and was one of your pledges during the 1992 presidential campaign|||0.982336223|1.18E-07
|||||
D1|The Police Corps offers educational assistance to qualified college students who commit to enter the police after graduation and serve in the force for at least four years|||0.998353243|1.71E-09
D1|Students accepted into the Police Corps receive up to $7,500 in educational assistance for up to four years of undergraduate study|||0.991168618|4.06E-07
D1|In addition, Corps recruits receive 16 weeks of rigorous training to help make them effective community police officers|||0.983151555|5.95E-08
D1|As an incentive to police departments to take recruits, state and local law enforcement agencies receive cash assistance for employing Police Corps officers -- $10,000 per participant for each year of the recruitâ€™s service.|||0.992160499|4.57E-10
|||||
D1|This announcement nearly triples the number of states that will receive Police Corps funds, from 6 to 17 states, and is double the funding appropriated in FY 1996 for the program|||-0.962136447|0.08468498
D1|It will fund about 650 recruits|||0.775161207|0.2214318
D1|Your FY 1998 budget contains $20 million in funding for Police Corps.|||-0.933392167|0.73498523
|||||
D1|3 Teacher Corps We believe your Summit speech should include a ringing call to service for young people to teach in inner cities|1||0.882168293|0.03217558
D1|Nothing would do more to breathe new life into the ethic of service than to enlist young Americans in a national effort to transform inner-city schools that are crying out for their energy, idealism, and talent.|1||0.954233468|0.18215436
|||||
D1|One way to do this would be to announce the proposal described below, which provides $400 million over four years in incentives for approximately 48,000 new teachers|1||-0.65689218|0.9904033
D1|If this seems too costly to propose in the current budget environment, it could be ramped up more slowly at about half the cost and impact|1||-0.976187289|0.9999949
D1|You could also propose a more modest expansion of AmeriCorpsâ€™ support for Teach for America, as long as we also address quality concerns about that program|1||-0.852954447|0.9997639
D1|Alternatively, your speech could simply include a strong call to young people to take up the challenge of teaching in inner cities without proposing a new initiative to provide federal support|1||-0.911731482|0.45448792
D1|Such an initiative could still be included in the Administrationâ€™s Higher Education Act proposal, which will be transmitted this summer.|1||-0.946004808|0.6678957
|||||
D0|Over the next decade, the nation will need to hire some 2.3 million teachers|||0.769024968|0.000291825
D0|Of these, approximately 15%, or 345,000 (approximately 35,000 per year), will be hired in central cities, in schools with large concentrations of low income students|||-0.820435286|4.82E-06
D0|An additional 207,000 (approximately 20,000 per year) will be needed in isolated, and often poor, rural areas|||0.845859766|0.009243728
D0|These types of communities face the greatest difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified teachers|||-0.998411655|0.000817604
D0|Urban areas in particular receive significantly fewer applications for positions than neighboring suburban districts, and attrition rates in urban areas can often reach 30% to 50% in the first five years|||-0.93044579|4.86E-07
D0|They are therefore most likely to fill classroom vacancies with teachers who lack preparation, donâ€™t meet licensure requirements, or who are teaching outside their field|||-0.999512076|5.56E-06
D0|As a result, the students in these communities -- who need the most qualified teachers in order to meet higher academic standards -- often get exactly the opposite in the classroom.|||-0.999757707|0.37544996
|||||
D1|We propose a new national effort to help attract and retain teachers in high poverty central city and rural schools|1||0.917211175|0.0001144
D1|This new initiative would be a part of the Administrationâ€™s proposal for the reauthorization of Title V of the Higher Education Act|1||0.731214345|0.045838412
D1|The basic framework for this initiative could be announced at the summit, while many of the details could be further  developed by the Education Department over the coming months.|1||-0.700958133|0.38933295
|||||
D1|This initiative would provide competitive grants to 100 local partnerships involving urban or rural school districts and institutions of higher education, to be used to provide incentives for individuals to prepare to teach, and to remain, in underserved schools|1||0.976272762|8.45E-06
D1|These would include 2-3 year fellowships for undergraduate students (including for a â€œSth yearâ€ program that provides intensive and sustained classroom experience for undergraduates after they have acquired a strong liberal arts background);|||0.966604114|4.05E-06
D1|one-year graduate fellowships for post-baccalaureate students, including recent liberal arts graduate and mid-career professionals seeking to enter teaching; stipends for teachersâ€™ aides and other education professionals seeking to move up a career ladder into full teaching positions;|||0.998451829|1.36E-07
D1|and 1-2 year â€œresidenciesâ€ for beginning teachers that would provide a lighter teaching load coupled with additional time for class preparation, being coached or mentored, or working in other ways with more experienced teachers.|||0.958579957|1.03E-05
|||||
D1|The incentives would range from fellowships that cover tuition and fees (which average $3,500 at undergraduate public institutions) to forgivable loans to salary supplements for beginning teachers|||-0.73557514|0.98620147
D1|Successful competitors would have to demonstrate that they have a high quality teacher preparation program, and that the program fits into a comprehensive, thoughtful strategy for recruiting and retaining teachers.|||0.998756886|0.26880926
|||||
D1|The Education Department proposes to fund this initiative at $100 million a year for five years, beginning with the FY1999 budget|1||0.826383889|0.08704528
D1|The Education Department estimates that this initiative will help attract and retain at least 48,000 teachers into high poverty central city and rural schools|1||0.97693187|1.38E-06
D1|This is approximately 17% of the estimated need in those communities|||0.995843351|0.000983512
D1|This is not an issue for this yearâ€™s appropriations battles, and we have not tried to identify a specific offset|1||0.935178399|0.40799838
D1|However, it will compete with your other discretionary priorities in the out-years|1||0.991072714|0.85185343
D1|If you wish to proceed, we will work with OMB to determine what funding level we can commit to right now, recognizing that the parameters of NDD spending may change before we submit the FY99 budget.|1||0.747868538|0.99993885
|||||
D1|We are also exploring ways to link this initiative to AmeriCorps, which already provides scholarships (but no stipends) to 1,000 teachers in Teach for America|1||0.74761045|0.04830822
D1|As you know, Teach for America has been fairly successful in capturing the imagination of the public and of college students, but to this point has not provided the preparation and support those new teachers need to succeed in the classroom and remain in the profession|1||-0.99730289|0.10651936
D1|We could use existing scholarship funds to expand AmeriCorpsâ€™ commitment to Teach for America, but we should also look for ways to make sure that preparation needs are addressed.|1||-0.980408788|0.989047
|||||
D1|4 Child Care Corps You could also announce that you will expand AmeriCorps to include a new child care corps|1||0.869599402|0.00811144
D1|The child care field has great difficulty attracting and retaining qualified workers, especially well-educated and trained workers who can go on to become leaders in the field|||-0.998844385|1.04E-06
D1|Your recent conference on early learning was the latest confirmation that it is critical to increase the quality of child care|||0.747406006|0.6592559
D1|Yet very few of our most talented young people enter this field.|||-0.701664567|0.3469123
|||||
D1|The program would offer AmeriCorps scholarships to individuals who agree to work in child care in low-income areas for two years|1||-0.970158577|0.000746389
D1|It would be open both to those currently working in the field and to those seeking to enter|||0.906640589|0.000227695
D1|Members of the corps would not get a stipend from AmeriCorps, but a scholarship of $4,725 a year for two years, which could be used either to repay existing student loans or to pay for further education|||-0.83565098|0.18638381
D1|Some of these scholarships could be earmarked to help people leaving welfare to get college training to become child care workers.|||0.913922012|5.03E-06
|||||
D1|The Corporation for National Service estimates that it could support a corps of 2,000 people a year without any increase in their budget or permission from Congress, as long as these individuals get only scholarships and not stipends as well|||-0.997598946|6.04E-07
D1|Under pressure from members of Congress to reduce the cost of an AmeriCorps member, the Corporation has begun to emphasize these â€œscholarship onlyâ€ awards, and its scholarship trust fund has excess funds.|||-0.992148399|0.001930792
|||||
D1|Non-profit groups would apply to become part of this program, and would have to demonstrate that they could offer participants high-quality training and mentoring during their two years of service, including development of management and leadership skills|||0.604376733|0.000132726
D1|In addition, corporations could sponsor members by paying for their salaries, and universities that specialize in early childhood education could match our scholarships.|||-0.998202443|7.37E-07
|||||
D0|5 Mentoring/Tutoring 1 Million Kids In preparation for the Summit, Federal agencies have joined their counterparts in the private and non-profit sectors by making public â€œcommitmentsâ€ to the goals of the Summit|||0.990350425|3.56E-08
D0|Agencies have identified over 40 initiatives where they will work with partners in the volunteer or service sectors to mentor and tutor kids, expand afterschool programs, and offer young people opportunities to serve|||0.997252643|4.95E-08
D0|We are trying to determine whether these commitments add up to an additional 1 million kids being mentored or tutored as a result of Federal government efforts.|||-0.767627239|0.06900754

D1|FIRST LADY SPEECH AT CLOSING CEREMONY The First Lady will represent the Administration at the closing ceremony on Tuesday|||0.911843061|0.97609293

D0|Police youth academies are active in many Communities across the country. The structure and participants vary greatly from program to program, but each one is structured around creating constructive interactions between police and young people|||0.997528255|4.12E-08
D0|Most of the existing  Programs are co-sponsored by law enforcement agencies and schools or community groups, including Kiwanis, YMCA, scouting organizations, and business groups.|||0.940657139|1.04E-06
|||||
D0|Components of Police Youth Academies Current academies contain some or all of the following program elements:  - basic orientation to law enforcement (arrest procedures, search procedures, ethics) ~ physical fitness and sports; - orientation to law enforcement as a career (challenges, responsibilities); - conflict resolution and dealing with peer pressure; - role-playing exercises for police-youth interactions; - field trips to jails, courts, training facilities, etc.; - antigang and drug programs; - building self-esteem and attitude management; - tutoring.|||0.999400973|1.49E-09

D0|Some programs allow any interested young person to apply|||0.85916239|0.015858142
D0|Some programs are adjuncts to other programs (such as the Boy Scoutsâ€™ Police Explorer program), and thus participants are drawn from that pool|||-0.885457277|0.000237771
D0|Others base participation on referrals from teachers, school officials or the police themselves in light of disciplinary matters or minor skirmishes with police.|||-0.582891047|6.36E-07

D0|The Athol, MA Youth Police Academy confers academic â€œextra creditâ€ on its participants.|||0.99376291|0.35404387

|||||
D0|Current Availability of Federal Funding There does not appear to be a realistic prospect of committing any FY 97 J ustice resources to directly support police youth academies|||-0.995148361|0.9972247
D0|Although the Bureau of Justice Assistance was appropriated a relatively small amount of truly discretionary funding, BJA already has issued program plans and solicitations that account for all of the available funding.|||-0.879210949|0.999746

D0|The COPS statute, as enacted, would permit the Department of Justiceâ€™s COPS Office to make discretionary grants to support police youth academies|||0.72832793|0.010123997
D0|See 42 U.S.CÂ§ 3796dd d)(5), (7) (grants authorized to develop and implement â€œcitizensâ€™ police academyâ€ and to â€œestablish and implement innovative programs to increase and enhance proactive crime control and prevention programs involving law enforcement officers and young persons in the communityâ€)|||0.997249901|2.29E-08

D1|Other Considerations While many of the police youth academies currently in operation appear to be popular and successful, it is our perception that a decision to make federal funding of police youth academies a priority would be greeted at best skeptically by police management and labor  organizations, and most likely with some degree of resentment or hostility|1||-0.989179611|3.32E-06

D1|In addition, the past and current appropriations for the Police Corps program, while the Law Enforcement Scholarship program remains unfunded, has engendered  dissatisfaction from many quarters in law enforcement that would be exacerbated by funding additional programs not benefiting police more directly.|||-0.997374177|5.05E-05

D1|I don't think we will need a full-blown, comprehensive and complete proposal, but I think we need something for the President to talk about in his speech|1||0.967113853|0.99939907
D1|Nobody here, including me,thinks the President will be satisfied with or well served by simply talking about options and appointing a task force to come up with a plan|1||-0.895468831|0.922266
D1|This approach will fail to capitalize on the incredible media attention at the summit, and may not sufficiently focus attention on the importance of attracting well prepared people into teaching|1||-0.999705493|0.9706782

D1|First, he can talk about what the federal government already does to make it easier for people to go into teaching -- Perkins loan cancellation/forgiveness, and income contingent repayment|1||0.814745188|0.5914694
D1|There are also more specific programs underway -- National Service funds an urban education service corps, and I think there is a troops-to-teachers program, but I donâ€™t know much about it.|1||-0.998514116|0.5037704
|||||
D1|Second, I think there is a core idea emerging in our discussions and your materials -- a focus on attracting and retaining well prepared teachers in underserved urban and rural areas|1||0.998988688|0.029095884
D1|It would be great if the President could announce the framework of an initiative to address this, leaving the details to be worked out later|1||-0.998600662|0.24855848
D1|I would suggest the following:|1||-0.716537595|0.50867784
|||||
D1|a competitive program, aimed at partnerships between city school districts, IHE's (colleges of ed and arts and sciences) and others as appropriate, including unions, existing recruitment and/or professional networks, etc.|||0.998489022|1.20E-06
|||||
D1|" competitors have to show that they have a quality preparation program strategy, and that they are locating this program in a comprehensive, well thought out strategy for recruiting and retaining teachers, which addresses teacher preparation, induction, ongoing professional development, and which leverages other local, state and federal resources in a strategic and â€˜coordinated fashion that gives each partnership funds to use to attract and retain well prepared teachers -- they can figure out themselves the mix most appropriate to target, including undergraduates  e.g., four 2-4 year fellowships that require a year-for-year committment to teach}, individuals who have completed a 4 year degree (e.g, seniors with a liberal arts degree or mid-career professionals who want to enter teaching) who will need an intensive ""5th year"", and paraprofessionals who will continue working and get financial help for college tuition as they work toward licensure."|||0.999650836|3.74E-08
|||||
D1|if the President were to announce a program centered on these components, he would make clear that this will be part of the Administrations HEA Title 5 reauthorization, to be transmitted later in the Spring or Summer (It appears that you are aiming for late September, though at one point I thought you were aiming for June)|1||-0.999068081|0.5353895
D1|I don't think we need a lot of details for something like this, though we would need to figure out how much we would be prepared to spend, starting in FY 99|1||-0.967751026|0.9999956
D1|We would also need to make some assumptions about the size of fellowships, and possible ways of dividing up funds between the three types of prospective teachers described above, so that we could estimate a range of teacher slots that would be filled through this initiative.|1||-0.664846838|0.9966629
|||||
D1|Third, there may some simple and appropriate steps that could be taken, or at least proposed, without much cost or complexity|1||0.991838872|0.99945503
D1|For example, what about making it easier for students to use work-study funds to pay for time they spend student teaching?|1||-0.995411456|0.31169346
|||||
D1|Fourth, there clearly are other options to consider -- expanded loan forgiveness, tax breaks, etc (though these approaches seem to me to be too costly, insufficiently targeted, and unlikely to make a real impact)|1||-0.999094605|0.99956304
D1|These and other options you may want to consider should not be foreclosed by a Presidential proposal at the summit.|1||0.980052352|0.975003
|||||
D1|I think approach along these lines will give the President what just about everybody here seems to think he needs next week, while not unduly tying the hands of the Department as you proceed|1||0.997364581|0.99537694
D1|This presumes that we can work our way through several things over the next few days -- (1} whether the Department is prepared to commit to an urban-focused initiative; (2) if so, the overall framework for it; and (3) a minimum tevel of investment for it, with the understanding that we will figure out how to pay for it during the FY 99 budget decisions|1||-0.960709393|0.73162085
D1|This assumes that we would be announcing something on the modest size|1||-0.99943012|0.99996305
D1|I would guess in the $80-$100 million range of 4-5 years.|1||0.563656449|0.99510443
|||||
D1|Elena and I talked to Justice this morning about the announcement|1||0.968585849|0.001527068
D1|They have been fighting us on this all the way|1||-0.890460789|0.000659569

|||||
D0|"The Crime Bill requires 20% of that program to be set aside for states to pay the costs of part-time or summer employment for high school juniors and seniors which consists of ""performing meaningful tasks that inform students of the nature of the tasks performed by law enforcment agencies."""|||-0.975555778|1.51E-06
|||||
D0|Our FY 98 budget submission asks for $20 million for the inservice scholarship program, so that that means we have a $4 million request for a police youth academy program.|||-0.999152303|0.93230164
|||||
D1|Justice said they would get back to us on whether the $4 million can only be used for salaries for the kids or whether it could be interpreted to be used for the cost of setting up the program.|1||-0.997588158|0.95961916
|||||
D1|If it is the former only, then we asked them to drait us legislation that would expand this program and the President could announce that he is sending it to the Hill -- and he could also announce guidelines for the $4 million program.|1||-0.999527335|0.92902076
|||||
D1|If it is the latter, we asked them to draft guidelines for this program that we could announce at the Service Summit.|1||-0.856366098|0.9874024
|||||
D1|Do you want me to write something up for this for the President's announcement memo or should I wait until I get more info from Justice?|1||-0.646520138|0.9823622
D1|Or do you want me to get the hell out of here because I am getting rolled by the Justice Department?|1||-0.732424736|0.64010775

D1|There are 2 ways we could add scholarship-only members of AmeriCorps: one is to tap out the excess in the trust fund, which could add a few thousand members a year;|1||-0.977410734|0.99559814
D1|and the other is to modify our budget request so that more of goes to the trust fund and less goes to grants to groups for stipends and other purposes.|1||-0.979401708|0.2265375

D0|Our 98 budget request for AmeriCorps is $422 million, with $100 million of that recommended to go into the trust fund|||-0.869824827|0.98214334

D0|This funding is supposed to fund 35,000 members (ramp-up is AmericaReads).|||-0.992281377|0.00327949

D1|We could madify the split of our budget request without increasing the total|1||-0.987356544|0.9984011
D1|This would be very popular with Grassley; unclear with other members|1||0.846361995|0.030519746
D1|The question is where to stop|1||-0.996541798|0.014337381
D1|At an extreme, OMB and I did very rough numbers that if we immediately transferred everything into scholarship only, we could fund something like 85,000 more people next year (assuming 40% are part-timers, which I'm not sure of)|1||-0.990465999|0.9990897
D1|If we did a major, sudden change, the world that is used to getting AmeriCorps people would have big problems scrambling for all that stipend money, and quite possibly some of the money would go unspent, which would be bad.|1||-0.948181272|0.99994445
|||||
D1|One option is that the increase we are proposing in the size of AmeriCorps could be all scholarship-only, but that could create the expectation that our America Reads people would be the ones who lose out on the stipend|1||-0.638055623|0.9999981
D1|Or maybe you like that idea|1||0.864238322|0.96820796

D1|OMB suggested increasing the local match rate over time|1||-0.947917283|0.008861139
D1|Currently applicants pay 15% of the stipend|||-0.557442248|0.85541564
D1|Increasing that to 25% or 30% would have the effect of freeing up scholarship only money, but it doesn't match the idea of challenging certain folks to come up with the whole stipend|1||-0.999256432|0.9993554

D0|On student loans and service, here's the story|||0.825839639|0.000671508
D0|There are 4 types of breaks on student loans you can offer people who serve.|||0.663588583|0.59740293
|||||
D1|1 Income contingency -- We did this in 1993|||-0.973700523|0.99566156

D1|2 Loan deferment -- This predates us|||0.995750666|0.9951681
D1|It is used when (1) someone wants to take time off during school but doesn't want to have to start paying back loans during that time;|||0.997695982|1.39E-07
D1|(2) someone finishes school, but argues they have a good reason they don't want to start paying back their loans|||-0.900902629|0.006111912
D1|You can get a deferment for up to 3 years|||-0.548784733|0.9447704
D1|"You are eligible if you are unemployed, or if it would create an ""economic hardship,â€ which includes service"|||-0.750520349|0.99737465
D1|There is no separate service deferment|||-0.5532704|0.03247092
D1|There used to be, but the system got so complex that it was simplified in 1992.|||-0.999091506|0.983526
|||||
D1|3 Subsidize all loan deferments for service-- This is our new idea|1||0.991459608|0.001461832
D1|This means that no interest accumulates on loans during the period of service|||0.988657415|0.8116496
D1|We already do this for subsidized loans, which are about 2/3 of the volume, so this would fix unsubsidized loans and make it universal.|||0.997023165|0.99999154

D1|The $7 million cost over five years would allow 12,000 borrowers with unsubsidized loans to get this benefit during their deferment|||-0.832345545|0.07261621

|||||
D1|In answer to your question as to whether we could do this for more than one year of service: This cost estimate already assumes that this could be for up to 3 years|1||-0.976798654|0.99784803
D1|"The estimate simply reflects historical data on people who request a deferment due to economic hardship for ""service-related"" reasons, so it is a mix of people requesting 1, 2, and 3 years of deferments"|||-0.998653054|0.2300898

D0|Dear Mr President, As I alerted you at Cardozo, this missive is inspired by Andrew Marvelâ€™s 17th century poem about â€œtimeâ€™s winged chariot,â€ and by the realization that you have a little more than a thousand days left in your presidency.||1|0.797604859|0.40163052

D0|Had we but world enough, and time, This coyness, Lady, were no-crime..||1|0.986458719|0.017241145
D0|But at my back I always hear Time's winged chariot hurrying near, And yonder all before us lie Deserts of vast eternity.||1|0.828092635|0.05339711

D0|Now therefore, while the youthful hue Sits on thy skin like morning dew..||1|-0.68436408|0.9727906
D0|Rather at once our time devour Than languish in his slow-chapt power||1|-0.653066933|0.53756124
D0|Let us roll all our strength and all Our sweetness up into one ball..||1|0.997760296|0.9900823
D0|Thus, though we cannot make our sun Stand still, yet we will make him run.||1|-0.96815747|0.10952511

D0|As you may guess, my proposition is that the time has come for you to do everything in your power to roll all your â€œstrengthâ€ and all your â€œsweetnessâ€ up into one ball||1|0.965211749|0.9928873
D0|And that the time to begin trying to do that is your State of the Union address||1|0.717732072|0.000435329
D0|My pitch goes beyond AmeriCorps and national service â€” though they are central and the reauthorization for the Corporation for National Service needs your championship in the address to Congress and months to follow||1|0.99581933|0.000102728
D0|I write here not so much as an agent for AmeriCorps but, if I may be so bold, as a coach for Americaâ€™s future and for the next thousand days of your Presidency.||1|0.989370704|0.9946526
|||||
D0|As an old civil rights hand and a veteran not only of national service, but also of the Peace Corps and higher education over the years, I see you on the brink of truly becoming the Education President, the Citizen Service President, and the President who leads us into the new millennium on the road to One America||1|0.996925652|5.13E-09
D0|The three themes of education, service and One America already run through your record as President and in the years before that||1|0.992689788|0.000522737
D0|They are three themes that people know run deep in you||1|0.982444108|0.045855906
D0|They are your special trinity.||1|0.998814702|0.021952262
|||||
D0|Now is the time, in an even fuller and stronger measure, to roll your efforts in these three vital areas into one commanding vision and one unified strategy||1|0.999627352|0.39133096
D0|If you succeed, the whole will be recognized as far greater than the sum of the parts||1|0.613303363|0.9999862
D0|The parts are not small, but so far most people fail to see how they come together in something very powerful and fundamental.||1|0.991452932|0.9788946
|||||
D0|As of now, one might predict that historians will acknowledge you as a President who, with indomitable spirit, under unprecedented continuous assault, made progress in many increments on many different fronts||1|0.90666157|0.9224763
D0|If that is all you did, it would be very good||1|-0.916860104|0.9979962
D0|But what I imagine, and more importantly what the spirit of the nation needs, is far more â€” that you speak and act in these next three years so you stand tall in history as the one who in the last half of this century ushered in a truly great transformation.||1|0.996473372|0.99840254
|||||
D0|Roosevelt led such a transformation in the crucible of the Great Depression||1|0.981404364|0.14658225
D0|Lincoln did it in the Civil War||1|0.810935199|0.04694649
D0|You can do it in our more complicated time, even though, as you have noted, it is very difficult when there is not an inescapable, galvanizing crisis.||1|0.989386559|0.99999833
|||||
D0|Yet, as you know, there is a quiet crisis of the American spirit â€” the civic spirit that made America great||1|0.569553077|0.90179044
D0|There is the slow-burning crisis of American youth â€” especially for the 15 million or more who lack the fundamentals for success||1|-0.997852564|0.22588041
D0|There is the profound crisis of American unity â€” of the two cities of rich and poor, and the divisions of race.||1|-0.804223895|0.000315954
|||||
D0|To galvanize the country for action to deal with this compound crisis, I urge you to embrace the strategy we used to organize the Presidentsâ€™ Summit â€” which is now our strategy in the post-summit campaign for Americaâ€™s Promise||1|0.996950626|0.46336174
D0|That is, to focus on the key problems for children and youth and work to bring together all the forces of our society, including citizen service and government at all levels, to solve these problems||1|0.99637115|1.12E-07
D0|And to do it by embracing and giving priority to the measurable goals set at the summit, around which Americaâ€™s Promise and our national service network are mobilizing people, state-by-state, and community-by-community.||1|0.998646796|0.042795297
|||||
D0|The Five Summit Goals encompass the themes of good education for ail, citizen service for youth and service by all young people, and common work by young and old, across all the lines that divide us, to build One America||1|0.998611808|8.47E-07
D0|The Goals include a healthy start and access to health care for all children, which is also needed to make America one, and for which you have also done so much.||1|0.98195225|0.25704116
|||||
D0|And the overarching vision is the one you have been articulating so well - One America||1|0.99904865|0.92510575
D0|It is that vision which connects the three themes||1|0.999891043|0.9439281
D0|Education is the great equalizer, but to achieve One America that succeeds in self-government, it must be education in the full sense, not just in the classroom and in training for jobs||1|0.948267758|0.9206403
D0|It must also be education in citizenship, in the ethic and practice of citizen service.||1|0.888465703|0.005439074
|||||
D0|Morally and strategically this focus on children and youth, on their education and on service to and by youth, is the right strategy for our time||1|0.997982264|0.17066641
D0|It is a common ground on which people of common sense can rally for the common good.||1|0.982417524|0.5817574

D0|When Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were killed the goals set by the Summit were the ones they were pointing to||1|-0.937556624|4.77E-07

D0|You conveyed so well the essence and centrality of this vision and strategy in your from-the-heart, stirring words to the volunteers at Cardozo||1|0.999322534|0.99932873
D0|You also articulated this clearly in your December interview with the New York Times, when you said your Race Initiative â€œneeds to be seen in the context also of what I have tried to do since I got here on citizen service, the whole idea of AmeriCorps, participating in the Presidentsâ€™ Summit on Service, all that.â€||1|0.956755459|0.8668944
D0|And your goal in a â€œlarger sense,â€ you said is, â€œto create an ethic of service across racial lines so that when we begin this new century and when I leave office and go off into the sunset, the typical American will have at least three opportunities for constructive engagement with people of other races â€” one at work, one at school, and one in community service working on common problems||1|0.977188945|0.00062576
D0|So I intend to try to work to sort of integrate all that.â€||1|-0.594667912|0.34421968

D0|With the vision of One America and that strategy for education and service, and with your strong and sustained leadership, I believe you can yet bring this country together around the great, unifying national cause we need.||1|0.996095359|0.69345415

D0|Background: Harris Wofford has written to urge that you resume former President Bushâ€™s â€œ Daily Points of Lightâ€ awards|||-0.877693653|0.82947266
D0|He proposes to rename the awards the â€œPresidentsâ€™ [plural] Points of Light,â€ with you and President Bush as co-sponsors|||-0.92454952|0.19690047
D0|Rather than having the White House take responsibility for selecting and vetting the winners on a daily basis, as was the case under President Bush, Harris proposes that the Points of Light Foundation and the Corporation for National Service take on this responsibility|||0.675501585|5.21E-05
D0|The Knights of Columbus have agreed to fund the costs of this program for one year.|||-0.979475141|0.001723126

D0|One factor complicating the decision is that Harris has had extensive conversations with the Points of Light Foundation and with President Bush himself on this proposal|||-0.53810817|0.011106647
D0|Apparently Harris has made it clear that he favors this idea and that the decision rests with the White House|||0.692057312|0.6162688
D0|Harris indicates that President Bush will be deeply disappointed if we decide not to resume the awards.|||-0.992742538|0.9996679

D0|One other timing issue is that you are scheduled to attend the dedication of President Bushâ€™s library in November|||-0.989459753|0.043730237

D1|Arguments For: Reinstating the awards is an easy way to keep the issue of service and volunteerism before the public on a daily basis|1||0.553880155|0.9951734

D1|Arguments Against: The benefits of resuming the awards are minimal|1||-0.985414982|0.9987801
D1|Our efforts to reach out to the volunteer sector at the Philadelphia summit were so successful that it is not clear what this would add|1||-0.663810134|0.8238612

D1|The daily responsibility of selecting and vetting winners will be time-consuming for White House staff, and not worth the effort|1||-0.999848723|0.16474722

D0|PURPOSE To announce significant budget initiatives to help break the cycle of crime and drugs|||0.985072076|0.21540233
D0|A new Justice Department report, also released today, shows that in 1997 more than threequarters of the nationâ€™s prisoners reported past drug use, more than half reported using drugs in the month before their offense, and one in six committed their crimes so they could purchase drugs|||-0.998151362|3.66E-05
D0|Responding to these findings, you will announce new resources to help states and localities systematically test, treat, and sanction drug-involved offenders -including $215 million in the FY 2000 budget to enforce â€œzero toleranceâ€ for drug use by prisoners, parolees, and probationers.|||0.984627962|0.1156593

D0|BACKGROUND Today the Justice Departmentâ€™s Bureau of Justice Statistics will release a new study on prisoner drug use (Substance Abuse and Treatment, State and Federal Prisoners, 1997)|||-0.52309376|1.33E-07
D0|Key findings regarding prisoner drug use include:|||0.86876601|0.19208893
|||||
D0|Vast majority of all prisoners report drug use|||-0.997006357|0.12709327
D0|In 1997, 83 percent of state prisoners and 73 percent of federal prisoners reported past drug use -considerably more than the 21 percent of state prisoners and 60 percent of federal prisoners who are serving time for drug offenses|||-0.913816214|0.001058756
D0|In addition, 57 percent of state prisoners and 45 percent of federal prisoners reported using drugs in the month before their arrest.|||-0.99890554|6.03E-06
|||||
D0|Many prisoners commit crimes to buy drugs or while high|||-0.935508668|0.012206448
D0|Nearly 20 percent of state prisoners and 15 percent of federal inmates reported committing their offense to get money to buy drugs|||-0.999578416|0.017368909
D0|And 33 percent of state prisoners and 22 percent of federal prisoners were actually under the influence of drugs at the time of their offense.|||-0.998524964|8.40E-05
|||||
D0|Drug offenders have long â€œrap sheets.â€ State prisoners serving sentences for drug offenses reported extensive criminal histories: 76 percent had been previously sentenced to prison or probation;|||0.677062511|2.51E-05
D0|54 percent were on probation or parole at the time of their arrest;|||-0.831644714|6.61E-05
D0|45 percent had three or more prior sentences, and 23 percent had previously committed a violent crime|||-0.996761799|0.000913013
D0|Although federal drug offenders generally reported less severe criminal histories, 59 percent had prior criminal records.|||0.676922321|0.001461756

D0|Director McCaffrey will make introductory remarks and introduce the Attorney General|||0.983297706|0.97750676
D0|The Attorney General will make remarks and introduce The Lt Governor|||0.95878768|0.024079565
D0|The Lt Governor will make remarks and introduce YOU|||0.969708622|0.12840538
D0|YOU will make remarks and then depart.|||-0.994559705|0.32477254
|||||
D0|REMARKS Provided by Speechwriting.|||-0.893680036|0.913143
|||||
D0|Q The Administration says that it has increased drug testing and treatment in the federal prisons, but the Justice Department report suggests a decrease in inmate treatment since 1991|||-0.954223037|0.000867895
D0|How do you explain this contradiction?|||-0.969255388|0.70513916
|||||
D0|We have definitely increased the number of federal inmates that are drug tested and treated|||0.997415304|0.5389391
D0|The 1994 Crime Act mandated that, by the end of FY 1997, all federal prisoners eligible for residential drug treatment should receive such treatment|||-0.99656713|0.31556827
D0|As a result, by 1998, the Federal Bureau of Prisons was conducting about 30,000 more drug tests per year and providing residential drug treatment to four times as many prisoners|||-0.619159698|2.45E-07
D0|The number of inmates participating in other types of drug abuse and education programs also increased during this time.|||-0.658032537|0.000666725
|||||
D0|However, these increases may not have kept pace with the rapid growth in the prison population during that same period|||-0.993674636|0.004613319
D0|In fact, between 1991 and 1997, the federal prison population grew by well over 50 percent (from 71,000 to about 113,000)|||0.709017098|2.37E-05
D0|Thus, even while more treatment slots were being made available -- and more prisoners were participating in other drug abuse and education programs -- the overall percentage in treatment may have declined.|||-0.99885726|0.02114289
|||||
D0|Finally, it should be noted that the Justice Department report includes a disclaimer saying that -- because the likelihood of receiving treatment increases as a prisonerâ€™s release date approaches -- it may have underestimated the total number of prisoners who will ultimately receive drug treatment.|||-0.976730764|0.7913925
|||||
D0|Q What will the overall increase in funding be for drug testing and treatment as a result of this new initiative?|||-0.560337365|0.8970642
|||||
D0|The â€œzero toleranceâ€ drug supervision initiative represents a funding enhancement of $112 million for FY 2000|||0.907441795|0.8694153
D0|This includes: $100 million in new funds for states and localities to drug test and treat prisoners, parolees, and probationers; an increase of $10 million for additional drug courts (from $40 to $50 million); and an increase of $2 million for the residential drug treatment in state prisons (from $63 million to $65 million).|||0.975623965|1.11E-08
|||||
D0|Youâ€™ve talked about a â€œzero toleranceâ€ policy for prisoners and drugs before, as well as requiring states to drug test and treat offenders|||-0.99752897|0.34048447
D0|What is really new about todayâ€™s announcement?|||-0.674414933|0.8050331
|||||
D0|Todayâ€™s announcement takes us a step further in accomplishing comprehensive testing and treatment for offenders in two significant ways|||0.998182535|0.5454593
D0|First, the Presidentâ€™s FY 2000 budget initiative proposes over $100 million in new, direct funds for states to carry out their own plans to test and treat prisoners and parolees|||-0.869216204|0.16833255
D0|And second, these funds can be used, for the first time, to begin to test and treat the over 3 million adult probationers -- two-thirdsof which have serious substance abuse problems.|||0.998850226|0.000282076
|||||
D0|What is the average cost of a drug test?|||-0.974685371|0.1977381
|||||
D0|The Federal Bureau of Prisons spends less than $9.00 per drug test for the nearly 130,000 drug tests it conducted last year|||-0.994780958|0.032651246
D0|Costs can vary depending on the number of drugs tested for, procedural requirements, and the number of tests needed (lower quantities will cost more.|||-0.966035843|0.99984646
|||||
D0|Is overall drug use increasing or decreasing? And how does it compare to the statistics contained in todayâ€™s report on prisoner drug use?|||-0.976569951|0.32221094
|||||
D0|According to the most recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, there were 13.9 million current drug users in 1997 -- or about half the number of drug users during the peak year of 1979|||-0.703136146|5.05E-07
D0|These nearly 14 million drug users represent about 6 percent of the American population age 12 and older, and the number has remained roughly flat since 1992.|||-0.998136163|3.33E-05
|||||
D0|By comparison, current drug use by prisoners has increased since 1991 and ranges between 5 to 10 times greater than the overall population.|||-0.975511193|0.00223624
|||||
D0|But isnâ€™t youth drug use increasing?|||-0.897507071|0.08231471
|||||
D0|Not according to the most recent study released by the Department of Health and Human Services|||-0.998674631|0.000407824
D0|The 1998 Monitoring the Future Survey showed that for the second year in a row, youth drug use, in nearly every category, has either decreased or leveled off among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders|||-0.999548137|0.004642963
D0|Specifically, marijuana use -- the most widely used drug by teens -- appears to have leveled off, with declines reported for the second year|||-0.99838376|0.7924907
D0|Just as importantly, youth attitudes toward drugs appear to be turning around, with more young people viewing marijuana use as risky behavior.|||0.568878412|0.414243
|||||
D0|So, while teen drug use remains unacceptably high -- and considerably higher than its low point in 1991 -- we are encouraged by these positive trends.|||0.994334579|0.99932027

D0|I took office determined to give all those children back their futures and ail those communities back their peace of mind|||0.973287582|1.20E-05
D0|In every successive year of my presidency, I have proposed and passed the largest anti-drug budget ever|||0.972630799|0.94642484
D0|Between 1996 and 1999 alone, we have increased funding for anti-drug efforts by more than 30% -- even as we produced the first balanced budget in a generation|||0.99774456|0.99984384
D0|And under the leadership of Gen McCaffrey, we have put these resources to very good use: Unprecedented new tools for domestic law enforcement|||0.998575449|0.003814487

D0|As you've heard from Gens Reno and McCaffrey, our strategy is working|||0.9978441|0.11193286
D0|Not only do we have the lowest crime rates in 25 years|||0.988317668|0.6872922
D0|Overall drug use is falling|||-0.999772131|0.1963427
D0|Even drug-use among young people is beginning to decline.|||-0.997798324|0.006389184
|||||
D0|But now is not a time to rest|||-0.808666825|0.002018918
D0|Now is the time to work harder than ever to build on these very encouraging trends|||0.988336384|0.351339
D0|At this time of prosperity, we have the resources, the proven strategies, and the confidence to make this new year the best year ever for reducing drugs and crime.|||0.999190032|0.004172873
|||||
D0|I believe that there is no better way to meet this ambitious goal than to expand our efforts to force prisoners to make a clean break from drugs|||-0.663663149|0.7155495
D0|Today, we are releasing a new study by the Department of Justice that offers even more convincing evidence that drug use stokes all types of crime, from property crimes like burglary and auto theft, to violent crimes like assault and murder|||0.963920951|0.000667335
D0|It shows that one in six offenders landed in prison for a crime he committed just to get money for drugs...that nearly a third of prisoners were using drugs at the time they committed their crimes...and that more than 80% of prisoners have a history of drug abuse|||-0.988292515|1.08E-06
D0|There is no question that if we are to continue reducing the rate of crime, we cannot afford to continue releasing criminals with their dangerous drug habits intact.|||0.766464949|0.2771825
|||||
D0|As you have heard from Gens Reno and McCaffrey, we have already done much to expand drug-testing and treatment in federal prisons and to encourage states to do the same|||0.932689369|0.7716981
D0|But today, we will make a quantum leap forward|||0.997312963|0.8305445
D0|I am proud to announce that the balanced budget I will submit to Congress will contain a $215 million zero-tolerance drug-supervision initiative, our nation's most comprehensive effort ever to test and treat not only criminals in prison, but also those out on probation and parole|||0.940602899|0.9984438
D0|To inmates in every state we will say: If you stay on drugs, then you'll stay behind bars|||-0.863865554|0.22494045
D0|And to probationers and parolees the message will be equally clear: If you want to keep your freedom, you have to keep free of drugs.|||0.852613688|0.8961312

D0|Through this initiative, we will also expand our efforts to help communities build and administer drug courts|||0.992347836|0.000352025

D0|In these final years of the 20th century, America has made tremendous progress in our efforts to free our children and our communities from the dangerous threat of drugs and crime|||0.998572946|0.002062775
D0|Now, as we begin a new century and a new millennium, we have a remarkable opportunity to harness all the resources of our criminal justice system -- our courts, prisons, prosecutors, probation officers, and police -- to break the drug habits of our prisoners, and break the cycle of drugs and crime for all time|||0.999257028|6.06E-07
