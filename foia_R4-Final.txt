D0|Issue Given opposition to the provision in the President's budget to intercept gambling winnings from parents who owe child support, should we: (1) Officially amend the proposal to make it a small scale demonstration, with voluntary participation on the part of gambling establishments, submitting a budget amendment with substitute pay-fors; or (2) Agree to not push the proposal.|||-0.997105062|8.73E-05

D0|Background on the Proposal The responsible fatherhood initiative in the President's budget includes new measures to:     1) collect child support from parents who can afford to pay;|||-0.737516582|0.00488965
D0|2) ensure that more child support goes directly to families; and|||0.975836396|2.77E-05
D0|"3) provide funds to help more ""deadbroke"" fathers who owe child support go to work."|||-0.821525872|3.55E-05
|||||
D0|The package of child support collection initiatives includes intercepting gambling winnings from parents who owe support, which will collect about $350 million for families and raise nearly $190 million in federal revenues over five years.|||0.846706033|0.000364592
D0|Gaming establishments currently must report to the IRS certain gambling winnings|||0.627132833|0.15457264
D0|under this proposal, they would also check to see if these individuals owe child support, and if so, retain winnings for the gamblers' children|||-0.610166311|0.009006866
|||||
D0|1 Under current law, tribal and nontribal gambling establishments must complete and send to the IRS form W2G, reporting the name, social security number and amount of winnings for patrons with keno winnings above $1,500, bingo and slot machine winnings above $1,200, and winnings above $600 when the winnings are at least 300 times the amount of the wager.|||-0.996150017|2.75E-08
|||||
D0|2 For all gambling winners exceeding the thresholds listed above, the gambling establishment would transmit the individual's name, social security number and amount of winnings via computer to a secure internet site where it would be matched against information on parents who owe at least $500 in child support.|||-0.999544442|0.000112247
D0|The match inquiry would report back: 1) there is no match and the individual does not owe past due child support;|||-0.988390446|0.002446801
D0|2) the individual owes past due child support which exceeds the amount of the individual's winnings, therefore, the entire amount of winnings should be retained;|||-0.586143851|0.99991894
D0|or 3) the individual owes child support but the amount does not exceed the amount of winnings; therefore, only the amount of child support owed should be retained.|||-0.890206039|0.9938082
|||||
D0|Reaction to the Proposal Opposition to.|||-0.968850255|0.38787362
D0|the child support gambling proposal has come from several sources.|||-0.98796612|4.51E-05
D0|Trtbal organizations have numerous concerns, including  that the proposal  was  made without consultation, violates their sovereignty by requiring them to enforce federal and state laws, and requires their gambling establishments to dedicate  staff time  and  other resources  to  collecting child support.|||-0.999365628|3.61E-07
D0|The National Indian Gaming Commission, the federal agency  with  oversight  of tribal gaming, opposes the proposal.|||-0.993076563|0.001772731
D0|Democratic members of Congress, in particular Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV), have also called for us to abandon the proposal because of the burden it would  impose on the industry.|||-0.998295009|0.27561235
|||||
D0|Child support legislation is likely to move through the Ways and Means Committee this Spring.|||-0.667052269|0.001003443
D0|Human Resources Subcommittee  staff are planning  a hearing in late March  and  a markÂ­ up in April.|||0.915899396|8.88E-06
D0|There is bipartisan consensus on the need to simplify the current child support  distribution rules, to ensure more child support goes directly to families, and the committee will need child support collection proposals to help offset the costs.|||0.908320129|0.29468316
D0|Currently, the committee staff have the gambling proposal, as well our other child support budget proposals, on their proposed list, which is not yet public.|||0.56798172|0.07312273
D0|However, Democratic staff think that because CBO has scored the gambling provision as raising only $36 miilion (compared to our nearly $190 millionscore), that  they will drop the gambling proposal if they receive protests.|||-0.998518884|0.99842465

D1|Pay-for Options Â· If we submit a budget amendment officially changing our proposal in a way that lowers the savings, OMB believes we should propose substitute pay-fors.|1||-0.996397555|0.99999654
D1|Several child support options are currently being examined;|1||-0.548172057|9.63E-06
D1|early estimates show they likely will raise only about $50 million of the cost.|1||-0.994582117|0.1386604
D1|The remaining costs could be made up by proposing a pay-for that HHS vigorously protested during the development of the budget, which would moderately reduce the amount of performance-based child support funds made available to states at the same time we make other changes that are advantageous to states.|1||-0.997649848|0.9999546

D1|If they really want to go ahead with this meeting, I would think we should talk about the tribal and nontribal parts of this proposal at the same time, which would lead me to think Leg Affairs should be invited.|1||-0.572647452|0.99127275

D0|Maria -- you asked where we were in setting up an internal meeting to discuss next steps on child support and gaming.|||-0.877445519|0.32336205
|||||
D1|As I have discussed with Lynn, Broderick, and Barbara, we are prepared to scale this proposal back to a demonstration, with voluntary participation on the part of a select number of gaming establishments.|1||0.907537937|0.12325656
D1|Thus, our legislative proposal would be to test this  idea, and we would seek gaming  establishments willing to participate voluntarily.|1||-0.993967056|0.001840246
D1|This should satisfy all concerns. .|1||0.985285461|0.7212639

D1|Since changing our proposal will result in losing budget revenue, we need substitute pay-fors.|1||-0.99679631|0.99735534
D1|OMB folks have been working diligently on this effort (we've been helping where we can).|1||0.994271636|0.094571
D1|As you know, uncontroversial pay-fors are h_ard to find, but we have several good things inÂ·development.|1||0.999244094|0.99960154

D1|Once we've crossed this hurdle, we should be ready to go.|1||0.998292387|0.028529527
D1|I think we all agree that we all have an interest in making sure this doesn't get out prematurely, because we a) don't want to get hopes up too early given the complications of the budget pay-for issues and|1||-0.792119861|0.9999796
D1|b) we want to have a coordinated roll-out to make sure all our friends get alerted properly and can take proper credit.|1||0.938709438|0.94894177
D1|Thus, we tried to the extent possible to make our meeting today with the National Indian Gaming Association into a listening session.|1||0.741319954|0.000437779
D1|They raised many good points.|1||0.994474471|0.004516455

D0|I believe we should stick to the same plan we worked out before -- we start off by saying we understand there are problems with our original proposal, and we'd like to hear from them about their concerns, and proceed to have mainly a listening session.|||-0.994954526|0.99520147

D1|OMB  will work on this with our help.|1||0.99615401|0.06358956

D1|HHS is apparently reviewing the recommendations|1||-0.995405912|0.91066617
D1|I don't really know what's in them, but there may be some savings associated with some of them (perhaps reduced Medicaid costs by ensuring kids get on their father's private insurance) that we could use to replace the gambling savings.|1||-0.657091618|0.96659696

D1|â€¢ I've looked into the option of having gaming establishments collect and report to the federal child support database tie gambling winner's name, social security number, home address and possibly his employer's name and address.|1||-0.999859452|8.18E-06
D1|In my view, the option would do little.to collect child support and we would still need to exempt tribes (lest we renege on our long standing support for tribal sovereignity).|1||-0.999765098|0.01922635
D1|The only advantage would be that it gives us a quasi-face-saving way to minimize opposition without abandoning our proposal altogether, which may be the best we can hope for at this point.|1||-0.519418776|0.99997365

D1|Please advise on how I should proceed.|1||0.773273587|0.092487834

D1|Should I begin selling .this reporting only option, with a tribal exemption, to 0MB,HHS, Leg Affairs, etc.?|1||-0.988922358|0.01490075
D1|Keep in mind Lynn Cutler specifically requested a meeting where she and others would be at the table to weigh in (but she should like this option).|1||0.986275554|0.000842752

D1|See below for more on the pros and cons of this option, and see the attached document for the wide range of unsavory options available to us..|1||-0.844797432|0.9955884
|||||
D1|Require only reporting from tribes and nontribal gaming establishments|||-0.979888082|0.025862055
|||||
D1|Pros: Likely to generate less opposition from gambling establishments, because it would require them only to report winnings, not collect child support.|1||0.779407322|0.8801656
D1|Allows us to minimize opposition without abandoning the proposal altogether .|1||0.999291658|0.9853596
|||||
D1|Cons: Unlikely to generate information the child support.office doesn't already have, and thus is unlikely to result in more child support collections or federal revenues.|1||-0.999085426|0.8525734
D1|For examnple, the child support office will already have access to the home address on the individual's drivers license, and in this process will only get a more up-to-date address if the individual volunteers it to the gambling establishment|1||-0.945876062|8.68E-07
D1|lf employer's name and address are also collected, this will require gambling establishments to collect more information than they generally do for the W2G and will increase opposition tb the proposal.|1||-0.999479473|8.00E-08
D1|ln addition, this impinges on tribal sovereignty by having the federal government impose a requirement on tribes|1||-0.998137355|0.3527545
D1|(the proposal builds on current law, requiring tribes to report and in some cases withhold funds for federal income taxes, which also impinges on tribal sovereignty.)|1||0.807199836|0.15544017
D1|We could therefore exempt tribes from this reporting requirement, generating more concerns from nontribal establishments.|1||-0.997308135|0.10802993

D1|Currently, we require states to deny drivers and professional licenses to parents who owe child support, but we allow such parents to obtain federal licenses.|||0.525458932|7.26E-06
D1|We are considering talkng action to remedy this situation.|1||-0.985164165|0.99835026
D1|Will you please respond to the following questions by Friday February 17|||0.625184774|0.6491435
|||||
D0|In your February 17, l 998 memorandum you discussed child support enforcement.|||-0.630684197|0.19218303
D0|You pointed out that states are required to deny drivers and professional licenses to parents who owe child support and that the Administratton is considering taking action to deny federal licenses to such parents.|||-0.943809152|0.002809124
D0|You provided a preliminary list of federal licenses and asked EPA to identify any that are missing from the list and to answer several questions about those licenses.|||-0.981168032|0.7709134
|||||
D1|The information you requested is attached.|||-0.740249634|0.375336
D1|"As you can see from the attachment, very few of the ""licenses"" granted by EPA go to individuals, as opposed to business entities."|||-0.689904749|0.34281164
D1|Accordingly we believe that few benefits and potentially significant costs could result from any effort to amend the various environmental licensing programs to include child support enforcement provisions.|1||-0.999316812|0.6958295
|||||
D1|"For purposes of this exercise considered the term ""license"" broadly to include licenses, permits, certification accreditations, and approvals that allow persons  to  undertake  activities within EPA's jurisdiction."|||-0.850925386|0.040191036
D1|The following is a list of licenses, permits, certifications,  accreditations and approvals issue (hereinafter licenses) by EPA|||0.713762283|2.93E-06
D1|In many cases the licenses are available both to individuals (mcluding those acting in a business capacity as a sole proprietor) to  ness entities such as partnerships and corporations.|||-0.536845505|1.25E-06
D1|It is probable that most of them are held by businesses rather than individuals, but we have included any license that might be granted to an individual|||-0.996796668|0.9322087
D1|(including those acting in an individual business capacity or as an employee required to have a specific  to do his or her job).|||0.791355848|3.34E-05
|||||
D0|You should also note that the authority to issue most of these licenses can be, and in most cases is, delegated to states (and in some cases tribes) under EPAs various statutes.|||0.823700428|0.8681257
D0|If a state or tribe has been d egated or authorized to issue the license EPA generally does not perform that function for that jurisdiction.|||-0.999106944|0.7112409
D0|Where the state or tribe is not delegated or authorized to perform this function, EPA would perform the function.|||-0.988873601|0.008507128
D0|Thus, to be complete, any approach to child support enforcement in this area would have to deny these types of licenses whether they are issued by EPA, by the states, or by tribes..|||-0.764208257|2.62E-05
|||||
D1|We do not have readily available information that would allow us to determine how many individual as opposed to business entities, have each of these kinds of licenses, but we  try to indicate below relative proportions of individuals as opposed to business entities receiving each kind of license.|||-0.98926115|0.9475099
D1|As you will see, we believe that only a few individuals receive these kinds of licenses from EPA, or from states and tnbes under EPA-delegated or authorized programs.|||-0.884405255|0.83757913
D1|Thus, there would not be much benefit from attempting to deny these kinds of licenses for people who have not paid child support, and dojng so may add considerable burden and complexity to federal, state, and tribal administration of these programs.|1||-0.983401299|0.06302077
|||||
D1|"Finally we do not believe we would have the authority under current law to be able to deny these licenses to individuals because they owe child support, accordingly ""legislation would Be neededâ€"|1||-0.974273384|0.297203

D0|Background: The purpose of 22 USC 6503 was to enforce the provisions of certain conventions entered into with foreign governments that permit commercial travelers (foreign traveling salesmen) of Contracting Parties to operate in the United States.|||-0.891413271|7.16E-05
D0|Enacted in 1922, this Act authorized the Department of Commerce to 1) issue licenses to manufacturers, merchants and traders domiciled in the other Contracting Party to operate as commercial travelers in the United States, and|||0.889212847|1.29E-09

D0|I spoke to Kohl's staff today.|||0.785169303|0.1250493
D0|"After very preliminary conversations with CBO, they think the bill will cost ""a few hundred million dollars."""|||-0.999242187|0.02129636
D0|Somewhere in the $200-$300 range.|||-0.988825619|0.9107676
D0|Still, a very preliminary estimate.|||-0.945241094|0.14114468

D0|I. Background: Under current law, states generally retain child support collected on behalf of TANF-assisted families as one of several sources of program financing.|||0.975914538|0.004041208
D0|This .support is split between the State and Federal Government  as  reimbursement  for  welfare  services.|||0.928217292|0.002432646
D0|Under welfare reform, states were given the option of continuing  the  previous  $50 pass-through,  but most states have opted not to do so.|||-0.944996238|0.8869862
D0|However, some pass-through a portion (typically $50) and disregard this amount in calculating the family's  TANF  benefits.|||-0.682859778|0.99823356
D0|A  few  (including  Wisconsin and Vermont) have federal waivers which allow them  to pass-through  all of the support collected to the family.|||0.974560678|3.64E-07
D0|Wisconsin disregards the support in calculating assistance -- Vermont does not.|||-0.999123991|0.98567164
|||||
D0|II. Issues: 1) Disincentives: Non-custodial parents of TANF assisted children are discouraged from paying support because their money goes to the government and does not benefit their children directly.|||-0.99944979|0.000953112
D0|Custodial parents also have less incentive to cooperate with the CSE agency since payments are generally not forwarded to them.|||-0.984817445|0.75010324
D0|2) Burdens: Support is distributed according to when it accrues, whether a family is or ever was on public assistance and by which method it is collected.|||-0.970909774|0.77294695
D0|This distribution system has proven burdensome and costly both in terms of programming and personnel.|||-0.999684334|0.9984043
D0|3)Unstable Financing: CSE caseloads have increased 44 percent since 1991, but TANF caseloads are decreasing.|||-0.998318434|0.9858538
D0|As discussed, states retain TANF collections, but distribute non-TANF collections directly to the families.|||0.998703122|0.17948449

D0|Child Support Pass-through|||0.88204509|0.16684438

D0|For those interested in an overall understanding of the federal rules that affect how child support collections are assigned and distributed, I recommend reading the Child Support enforcement section of the Green Book (http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/wm001.htm1).||1|-0.779851735|0.00617845
D0|For a more focused description of how child support distributions affect||1|0.787676454|0.5141675
|||||
D0|Here's what these reports basically say: For families that are currently on welfare the rules for distribution of child support collections are generally straightforward||1|-0.909855843|0.9994698
D0|(distribution rules for families that are not longer on welfare are  a little more complicated).||1|-0.921982169|0.97558665
D0|"Under AFDC, the first fifty dollars of child support collected on behalf of a family was ""passed-through"" to the family currently on welfare."||1|-0.991360724|6.56E-05
D0|The remaining child support collections were split between the state and federal government (according to state medicaid match rates).||1|-0.97051245|2.19E-06
D0|"Since the $50 ""pass-through"" was not counted as income, it increased the amount of the welfare grant by  $50."||1|-0.992702127|0.9309277
D0|The idea behind this was to give mothers a financial incentive to cooperate with child support enforcement.||1|-0.742123127|0.00355589
D0|"Under TANF, the fifty dollar ""pass-through"" was repealed and states must first pay the federal government its share of the child support collections (again, according to the state medicaid match rates)."||1|-0.928213894|0.005146782
D0|The rest of the child support collected on behalf of a family currently on welfare is distributed at the discretion of the state.||1|-0.675177634|0.000644202
D0|If the state wants to continue distributing $ 50  of the child support collected on behalf of a family to that family, it may do so (although the  $50  will come from the state's share of the child support  collection,  not  off  the top as under AFDC rules).||1|-0.994398057|1.25E-07
D0|In this case, the welfare check again increases by $50.||1|-0.992296636|0.002368333
D0|"Unfortunately, most states (29 according to the ""One Year After"" paper) have decided not to pass-through any amount of the child support collected on behalf of a family with the result that  child support  collections  have no affect on the size of the ' welfare grant in these states "||1|-0.949783325|1.00E-06
D0|(unless, of course, the amount of child support collected is greater than the welfare  grant  at  which point the welfare grant is reduced to 0 and the family gets the full child support payment).||1|-0.988296807|0.000195782
D0|In the 22 states with a child support  pass through, the size of the welfare grant is affected by child support collections, equal to the amount of the pass-through  (in most of these states, it is still $50.)||1|-0.933900476|2.49E-07
|||||
D0|I hope this clears  things up.||1|0.996249378|0.53344035
|||||
D0|As far as the child support not affecting the cash grant, I just  interviewed a whole slew of women in sunflower county MS who said they  refused to stay on TANF because the cash grant was less than their child  support benefit so they chose to take the child support because they cannot  get both.||1|-0.997465491|0.003630324
D0|This is a different point.||1|-0.665359497|0.32017368

D0|I apologize for the delay in sending this summary out.|||-0.99173522|0.28563255
|||||
D0|One of the main purposes of this meeting was to brief W&M staff on how the State VR programs work (e.g., the fact that priority is given to serving individuals with the most significant disabilities).|||0.538618386|3.92E-06
D0|Below is a brief summary of the other important items that were discussed.|||0.877579272|0.13836539
|||||
D0|Agreement with State Rehab Agency: W&M staff asked ED about the purpose of sec. 1148(c)(3){D) in the Senate bill, which states that no payment can be made to an employment network who either makes referrals to a State agency in violation of their agreement  with the agency, or has not entered into an agreement.|||-0.992350161|1.29E-07
D0|"ED staff noted that this language is intended to prevent employment networks from ""double dipping""  by referring an individual to  a State  VR agency for specific services, and then being reimbursed for the services provided,by the State VR agency."|||-0.966504097|2.10E-05
D0|W&M staff was concerned that the bill language would essentially  reassign the  ticket  to the VR agency.|||-0.997539043|0.83449864
D0|ED said the language just requires the provider to reimburse the Rehab agency, not give up the ticket, but said that it would look into this issue.|||-0.982356906|0.9918452
|||||
D0|Mode of Election for Reimbursement: W&M staff asked about Sec. 1148 (c)(1) in the Senate bill, which gives only State agencies the option of  operating  under  the  old or the  new  payment  system, on a case by case basis.|||-0.923015833|1.17E-06
D0|ED justified this language by  saying that, under  this  bill, the m.ost  difficult and risky cases (e.g., the most severely disabled) will most  likely  wind  up  in  the  State  agencies rather then private providers, and that the reimbursements for  these  individuals  would  usually  be lower under the new payment system.|||-0.602755308|0.9997738
D0|W&M staff said that  they  were  concerned  that  private providers do not have the same option in the Senate bill.|||-0.972958982|0.000990923
|||||
D1|Big Picture -- Competition: W&M staff asked ED if both they and the State rehab agencies are generally concerned that this legislation would increase competition between State rehab agencies and private providers.|1||-0.534638345|0.060280435
D1|ED noted that they support the  Kennedy-Jeffords legislation in its  current form (though they have concerns  with, for instance, the P&A language),  and that competition isn't a major issue with the Department because there are more than enough people for both the State rehab agencies and private providers to serve.|1||0.948685348|0.14307202
|||||
D1|P&A: ED brought up it's concern that the Senate bill only provides a generic reference to providing information on obtaining employment and advocacy, rather than the more specific P&A language included in last year's draft H.R.  3433.|1||0.755366027|0.927578
D1|W&M said that they'd take ED's  concern under advisement.|1||0.545282602|0.7686598
|||||
D1|I agree with Jonathan's comment.|1||0.833792329|0.55615294
D1|I also would suggest that the first paragraph be made longer, Jeanne what do you think and what  would  you add?|1||-0.95882386|0.99711156

D1|I would also amend the second graph as follows:|1||-0.998042703|0.2512424
